5,"  A good movie, but a very Bad Star Wars movie !!!"
5,"  ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY WHAT THEY DID TO MARK HAMILL.This borderline killed the franchise, unless the revive luke with that actor who plays the winter soldier !"
50,  Amazing! The risks taken were all worth it
50,  As a fan since the original episode IV when I was a young lad....this movie was great. Can't wait for the next one.
45,"  at one point it is necessary to cut the umbilical cord, it is the best film of the saga"
20,  Disappointed story line for Luke. Rip off of All three of the original movies. Nothing original.
45,  Disney killed Star Wars. Poor attempt at a Star Wars movie.
40,  Don't listen to the negative discussion online about this movie. It's a great movie! Check it out.
20,"  Due stelle solamente per la buona volontà della sceneggiatura audace - finalmente si indaga la doppia natura di ogni personaggio dove luce e ombra convivono. La realizzazione e la regia tuttavia hanno prodotto uno dei peggiori mostri del nostro tempo, dove epoca e demenza si fondono insieme. Se non l'avete visto non vi siete persi niente."
35,  Entertaining enough but feels somewhat unsatisfactory.
10,"  Extremely bad story writing, i think any star wars fan could have wrote this movie better"
5,"  HORRIBLE!!! I understand Disney, Rian Johnson, J.J.Abrams (who has made a career out of making crappy re-boots of good movies) and others wanted to ""go in a different direction"", but if you take a thing, then change a thing -it is no longer the same thing. This is no longer Star Wars. They tossed Star Wars over their shoulder like Skywalker tossed his old lightsaber. ""The Force Awakens"" was garbage and ""The Last Jedi"" was a dumpster fire. I am definitely staying home from all future movies ""based on characters created by George Lucas"". I refuse to call these movies ""Star Wars"".Oh, and all these ""Critics"" who gave the movie rave reviews are SJW wingnuts who know absolutely nothing about what made the first 6 episodes great."
50,  I found this movie to be far better than I expected.
15,"  I have not seen any trailers, I have had 0 expectations from the movie, trying my best not to get too disappointed. I have became disappointed. Brilliant scenes, soon ruined by... god knows what the writers/director were thinking. Much like the critics, I have absolutely no idea how they give this movie a 93% rating.It was short of a complete failure in my opinion. The movie, which, in essence, is about nothing, lacks that 'star wars' feeling to it. Again, same mistakes as in The Force Awakens have been made; as well as many new ones.On the bright side, it made The Force Awakens seem bit better."
50,"  I loved this movie and was filled with enjoyment in every second! I was shaking when we heard the star wars melody again in almost 2 years! overall It was a good narrative and good acting and overall, Good fun!"
10,"  I'm not a fanboy (or a boy at all), though I enjoyed the original trilogy quite a lot. This movie is simply a narrative mess with so many shaggy dog dead-ends and extraneous characters...Why the critics are so praising of it I'll never know. My biggest gripe: It's long past time for a Black Jedi. Why can't there be two? Why do the white woman get all the glory and win all the gold stars? (I'm a white woman incidentally...) Such a disappointment."
50,"  I'm not going to go into what I liked or didn't in this movie, just know that as a Star Wars fan it will be a fun ride and you will enjoy it!"
5,  It sucked. Did rian johnson even WATCH THE FORCE AWAKENS.
50,  it was better than the last one
5,"  It was terrible and horrible. No answers, no lightsaber fights, no nothing."
10,"  Just an extended advert for toys, especially mogwai looking little critters."
40,"  Kicsit még emészteni kell, de alapjában jó volt. Viszont a szinkron az valami szörny? - szerintem."
35,"  La película tal cual es buena con respecto a la saga deja un poco que desear, no es la mejor de toda la saga pero seguro tampoco es la peor, hay desiciones de guion muy buenas como también tiene muy malas. Los efectos visuales son hermosos. Me gusta que no es un fan service de darle al espectador la historia que quería si no una gran historia que abarca lo grande que es el espacio como para que todo tenga que estar estrictamente relacionado. Si hay personajes completamente desperdiciados que dejan mucho que desear pero el desenvolvimiento que tienen los demás personajes es bueno. Tiene aspectos positivos y negativos como cualquier película sin embargo la gente no le puede llegar a gustar por la nostalgia y porque quería que ocurrieran como ellos esperaban para mi fue un gran giro de la trama y un aire fresco a la saga y no hay que negar que es una buena película."
40,"  Loved it. Great opportunity to expand the franchise beyond the Skywalkers, let us all remember who Anakin really way here. Looking forward to Episode 9"
50,"  LOVED IT. I want to see it again. The filmmakers said many times that this movie is a turning point for the saga to move on with new characters and situations. I personally want the old crew and fun back, and am a little war-weary, but hey I'm a traditionalist in many ways ... but able to embrace change. Still, I wish for the eye and ear candy surprises of warming up inside an animal... the bar scene, Old Ben being cheeky with stormtroopers, the enormously villainous Darth Vader, and all the old Skywalker magic. I miss it! So, I battle on with the saga and enjoy it, with some regrets."
50,  Loved it. Not what I expected at all.
50,"  Not sure where all the hate is coming from, really good movie and definitely better than the paint by numbers star wars that was episode 7"
50,  Phenomenal! Best movie of the franchise
50,"  Rian Johnson takes the ""Star Wars"" universe and injects depth and gravitas in ways I didn't expect. The low audience scores are clearly fanboys who didn't get the story the wanted. If they would just get past their shallow disappointment, they would see a rich and satisfying story that is awesome in its unexpected-ness."
5,  Rotten tomato gave 93% to this??? Loosing trust on critics!!!
40,  So much better than crappy Force Awakens.
50,  So of the most emotionally powerful scenes in Star Wars history.
5,"  So sad with this film. It's the worst of the saga. It's worse than Clone Wars. It's a fact that has some fantastic scenes and some marvelous moments. However, I'm so sad!!!"
5,  Such a wasted opportunity. Terrible movie.
5,  Super disappointed after waiting such a long time for this movie and it turned out to be one of the worst.
10,"  Terrible movie, showing Disney's flaws and the amount of SJW influence. No respect for the source material. You ruined all the potential Disney. Shame on you."
50,"  The Last Jedi was a bold, refreshing ride in a galaxy far far away. I absolutely loved it! Let go of your expectations and enjoy the ride. This one won't go the way you think. I can't wait to see it again!"
25,  The movie was ok. Nothing special. Made me dislike the character of Kylo Ren even more.
30,"  There was a lot I liked about the movie but a few things I cannot let go. First it was not Luke's time to perish. 2nd when Luke first held his lightsaber again, it should have brought back some epic memories in some sort of flashback scene. Luke would have always understood what turns a jedi to the dark side. He would never just give up on the jedi like he was portrayed. When yoda showed up, Luke should have showed more humility and reverence for his former master. It was almost like oh hey yoda... I also think the seriousness of the situation Anakin and Obi one should have been there with Yoda mentoring Luke. The movie was good, but not good enough for a true star wars fan."
5,  This film is a piece of shit. Rian Johnson simply destroyed Star Wars' legacy.
10,  This movie sucked. It's meant for children
5,  what a piece of #$#$#. even so it was better than the last one. do these people even understand that the ships have light speed? i'm done with these movies. i'm embarrassed for everyone evolved.
50,"  Very rewarding Star Wars movie,"
50,  This movie was amazing--all of you whiners need to quit whining.
20,"  Visually the best Star Wars film. I just don't like Luke's portrayal, storyline, nor the lame force projection death at the end. I can nick pic other scenes like Leia flying through space and Admiral Ackbar's sudden no tribute death. BUT, OVERALL STILL A GREAT STAR WARS FILM! Damn you Rian Johnson!"
10,  Was an ok film but a poor Star Wars. Lazy writing. Character development was poor.
10,  Way to many plot holes and totally rips apart everything force awakens did
5,  Worst Star Wars movie
,
,
5,This movie sucked. Total letdown.
25,very dissapointing for the star wars universe and the crap-tastic version of the Last Jedi.. I hope JJ Abrams fixes up this mess in 9..
5,Breaks my heart to say it. This movie was such a disappointment. Pretty much just ruined Star Wars for all fans. Completely ruined Luke Skywalker. Boring subplots. and NO LIGHTSABER DUELS.. ru kidding? Movie sucked
40,"I liked it a lot. I'm a SW fan but not a super fan. I never read any of the books or played the video games. This movie looked great, sounded amazing, had great acting, great action scenes and was funny. Perfect 5/7"
50,"Let me preface my review by saying this; I loved this film to bits, and after leaving the theater for the first time I found very little to criticize. So when I saw the 55% of audience liked this film I was deeply shocked. That was until I read the audience reviews, and thats when I realized half the people wouldn't know a good movie, or a good star wars movie if it hit them in the face. If you want to see my thoughts on the movie that'll be further down, but I wanted to highlight some of the idiocy on display from my fellow movie viewers; and pick apart some of their criticisms with the film."
10,Disappointing garbage. The only thing this movie has on Episode 1 is no JarJar Binks character. I cannot decide if I rate it above or below Episode 1 as the worst Star Wars movie ever.
20,"If you are a not a Star Wars fan then this is your movie, go have fun, leave. If you are casual or more Star Wars fan then this is going to disappoint you. Too many plot holes, broken continuity, poor characters. The more I think about the movie the worse it gets. Help us JJ Abrams, you are our only hope?"
5,Disgrace to the Star Wars series. Ditches the long term Star Wars community for general-public guardians of the galaxy-loving people.
10,Way too many plot holes... And pathetic ending to star wars greatest character... nothing made sense... a ship running out of fuel?? Lmaoo and a slow-mo Chase? Are you kidding... epic disappointment... by far the worst chapter
5,Really enjoyed the film.
50,"I made an account just to write a review of this movie. Best star wars movie, period. I don't get why people dislike it so much, character arcs made sense, the plot was alright, and I feel like they did almost everything right. You expect one thing and then BAM, NOPE. Awesome movie, old star wars fans will never be appeased no matter what. Nostalgia makes everything infinitely better, you wanted a star wars movie, this is what you got. Best use of my money in a very long time, absolutely worth the watch"
50,"Amazing! So many surprises. Such good filmmaking and storytelling. This isn't inside baseball - it's not concerned with confirming people's reddit theories or making references that only the hard-core geeks will recognize. The galaxy is an open-ended story now, and anything can happen."
10,"This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. Important details go unexplained, there are plot lines that are pointless that does not move the story forward, the main villain is weak both in the force and in character, there's a whole lot of goofiness that shouldn't be there (and people said jar jar binks was bad) and certain individuals become strong in the force with zero explanation as to how they got there with no training. I didn't like Episode 2 & 3 but this one was worse than those 2."
10,"There is a way to make a successful film without crapping on all the past work. If you want to undo the original plot of the trilogy, then make the new films 1000 years after ROTJ and not connected to the Skywalker lineage ... What you are doing now is just trashing on 30 years of history to sell tickets and invalidating the complete themes in Episodes 4-6."
20,Story doesn't make sense. It's like they just decided to ignore everything prior.
5,A major disappointment.
50,Great movie if you don't have sky high expectations of what you want the movie to be. Just go in with an open mind and you will enjoy it :)
10,"I just don't understand... no really. Can you tell me the plot of this movie? I'll wait for you to try to explain to me but in the mean time I'll tell you that this movie sucks. So before I rant get to know me. I loved Star Wars and even in elementary i would talk about Star Wars. I have all the games and I dressed like earth Vader all through my childhood. So I love Star Wars with a passion. This movie destroyed my childhood. In the movie they explain things no one cares about and the real story they give you half a** answers like an example is snoke; who is he and where did he come from?
No we will just kill him and tell you in the books. What's kylo's motivation to do the things he does? Why does Luke die, Because he used the force? Is there a f***ing limit on the force now? They literally introduced a planet that was poorly added to the story and they will probably never use that planet. I think I'm the movie if they used commonsense, it would have been a 30 minute movie. They also ruined Luke (before he died in a stupid way) like an example would be when Rey walked up to him with his dads lightsaber. Like Luke would want to know where she got that and would ask questions. Nope he just throws the only thing of his father and half his life out for a quick laugh (it wasn't even funny) I would keep going but I think you get the point. Don't expect too see a Star Wars movie. Expect too see eye candy and a bad plot. Also I've seen it twice and it gets worse so my rating will be 3/10 just because the action that's it"
50,"Loved it. Saw it Friday with my parents. My mom has only seen Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back, to her, it was meh. My dad and I have seen them all and saw Rogue One together as well. He and I loved it.The thing I loved most about it was seeing Carrie Fisher.I also liked the complexity of the relationships. Planning to see it again on the 25th and hoping to do the IMAX to see the difference (dad can't see 3D so we went for a more classic movie presentation) and to catch the things I missed in the first go around because I was too focused on seeing Carrie Fisher on the screen.One thing I can say to folks wanting to see it, this movie feels like it was written and directed by someone who loved Star Wars as a story. As an overall over arching storyline. This was written as if to fleshout something long dreamed or long played out in the head of a true fan of Star Wars (original 3). So, don't listen to the naysayers, instead, make up your own mind. I found it in keeping with the originals for storytelling."
50,"This is the Star Wars film that has the longest running time, answers pretty much all unanswered questions so far and also drops you straight in at the deep end. Fans of Star Wars will lap it up, for the rest of us it's still an engrossing and enjoyable ride. Bravo to the director for also trying to move in a new direction."
40,Good movie. It doesn't deserve all the vitriolic hate it's getting...
20,"Never took off....critics are wrong. Rian blew the opportunity to answer lots of questions set up by The Force Awakens and didn't. It's too bad, I had high hopes for this movie."
5,By far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. A complete con job. Franchise destroyed. Not even one light saber duel
5,Rian ruined star wars. I could've written a better story than this garbage.
50,"Loved it. Fantastic Storytelling, Visuals and Spectacle. Earns a unique place in the galaxy"
40,Though it did have some poor humor and scenes that just didn't feel like they belonged or went anywhere. Overall this is a beautiful and emotional ride of a Star Wars film. A must see. But a must see twice.
5,the only way to fix this is for Episode 9 to open with Luke waking up and finding out The Last Jedi was all a dream...
5,the only way to fix this is for Episode 9 to open with Luke waking up and finding out The Last Jedi was all a dream...
45,"""This isn't going to go the way you think"" Luke said. And he's right. And the result is -- rather than a story that ""rhymes"" so much we don't get anything new, we got familiar settings with completely different circumstances. To me, Star Wars has been life at times. You know what doesn't go the way you think? Life. RIan did really well."
5,"Genuinely Bad. Space gravity wouldn't arc energy cannon blasts, and the energy of said blast wouldn't dissipate over the vacuum of space. This makes the whole premise flawed to begin with. The Finn story is just god awful, and managed to make a fancy star wars casino agrivating. Also, the film seems to play politics a bit with the personification of corporate greed. Just unnecessary. Also the interaction between the Pink haired Lady, Poe and PL was very dumb."
5,Silver lining: coolest lightsaber battle ever. Ray/kylo are awesome together.
5,Worst Star Wars yet. They should be paying people to sit through this garbage.
5,Love it so much! best movie of 2017!
5,The movie was really good...my kids and I loved it!
50,"This is a great film! Mark Hamill turns in the performance of his career. The imagery is wonderful, a solid story, well told. There seem to be a lot of people who are miffed because Rian Johnson didn't give them the movie they had already made up in their own heads. Don't listen to them. Just watch the movie for what it is - and be happy!"
5,unwatchable garbage. offensively bad.
30,As a huge Star Wars that loves the mythology that Lucas created I was a bit disappointment with this outing. It still had a lot good. It was entertaining and visually appealing. But I can't help to feel something was missing. The force was not with this movie.
