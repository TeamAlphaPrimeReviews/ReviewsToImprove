stars,good/bad,review,,,,,
5,bad,"  A good movie, but a very Bad Star Wars movie !!!",,,,,
5,bad,"  ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY WHAT THEY DID TO MARK HAMILL.This borderline killed the franchise, unless the revive luke with that actor who plays the winter soldier !",,,,,
50,bad,  Amazing! The risks taken were all worth it,,,,,
50,bad,  As a fan since the original episode IV when I was a young lad....this movie was great. Can't wait for the next one.,,,,,
45,bad,"  at one point it is necessary to cut the umbilical cord, it is the best film of the saga",,,,,
20,bad,  Disappointed story line for Luke. Rip off of All three of the original movies. Nothing original.,,,,,
45,bad,  Disney killed Star Wars. Poor attempt at a Star Wars movie.,,,,,
40,bad,  Don't listen to the negative discussion online about this movie. It's a great movie! Check it out.,,,,,
20,bad,"  Due stelle solamente per la buona volontà della sceneggiatura audace - finalmente si indaga la doppia natura di ogni personaggio dove luce e ombra convivono. La realizzazione e la regia tuttavia hanno prodotto uno dei peggiori mostri del nostro tempo, dove epoca e demenza si fondono insieme. Se non l'avete visto non vi siete persi niente.",,,,,
35,bad,  Entertaining enough but feels somewhat unsatisfactory.,,,,,
10,bad,"  Extremely bad story writing, i think any star wars fan could have wrote this movie better",,,,,
5,bad,"  HORRIBLE!!! I understand Disney, Rian Johnson, J.J.Abrams (who has made a career out of making crappy re-boots of good movies) and others wanted to ""go in a different direction"", but if you take a thing, then change a thing -it is no longer the same thing. This is no longer Star Wars. They tossed Star Wars over their shoulder like Skywalker tossed his old lightsaber. ""The Force Awakens"" was garbage and ""The Last Jedi"" was a dumpster fire. I am definitely staying home from all future movies ""based on characters created by George Lucas"". I refuse to call these movies ""Star Wars"".Oh, and all these ""Critics"" who gave the movie rave reviews are SJW wingnuts who know absolutely nothing about what made the first 6 episodes great.",,,,,
50,bad,  I found this movie to be far better than I expected.,,,,,
15,bad,"  I have not seen any trailers, I have had 0 expectations from the movie, trying my best not to get too disappointed. I have became disappointed. Brilliant scenes, soon ruined by... god knows what the writers/director were thinking. Much like the critics, I have absolutely no idea how they give this movie a 93% rating.It was short of a complete failure in my opinion. The movie, which, in essence, is about nothing, lacks that 'star wars' feeling to it. Again, same mistakes as in The Force Awakens have been made; as well as many new ones.On the bright side, it made The Force Awakens seem bit better.",,,,,
50,bad,"  I loved this movie and was filled with enjoyment in every second! I was shaking when we heard the star wars melody again in almost 2 years! overall It was a good narrative and good acting and overall, Good fun!",,,,,
10,bad,"  I'm not a fanboy (or a boy at all), though I enjoyed the original trilogy quite a lot. This movie is simply a narrative mess with so many shaggy dog dead-ends and extraneous characters...Why the critics are so praising of it I'll never know. My biggest gripe: It's long past time for a Black Jedi. Why can't there be two? Why do the white woman get all the glory and win all the gold stars? (I'm a white woman incidentally...) Such a disappointment.",,,,,
50,bad,"  I'm not going to go into what I liked or didn't in this movie, just know that as a Star Wars fan it will be a fun ride and you will enjoy it!",,,,,
5,bad,  It sucked. Did rian johnson even WATCH THE FORCE AWAKENS.,,,,,
50,bad,  it was better than the last one,,,,,
5,bad,"  It was terrible and horrible. No answers, no lightsaber fights, no nothing.",,,,,
10,bad,"  Just an extended advert for toys, especially mogwai looking little critters.",,,,,
40,bad,"  Kicsit még emészteni kell, de alapjában jó volt. Viszont a szinkron az valami szörny? - szerintem.",,,,,
35,bad,"  La película tal cual es buena con respecto a la saga deja un poco que desear, no es la mejor de toda la saga pero seguro tampoco es la peor, hay desiciones de guion muy buenas como también tiene muy malas. Los efectos visuales son hermosos. Me gusta que no es un fan service de darle al espectador la historia que quería si no una gran historia que abarca lo grande que es el espacio como para que todo tenga que estar estrictamente relacionado. Si hay personajes completamente desperdiciados que dejan mucho que desear pero el desenvolvimiento que tienen los demás personajes es bueno. Tiene aspectos positivos y negativos como cualquier película sin embargo la gente no le puede llegar a gustar por la nostalgia y porque quería que ocurrieran como ellos esperaban para mi fue un gran giro de la trama y un aire fresco a la saga y no hay que negar que es una buena película.",,,,,
40,bad,"  Loved it. Great opportunity to expand the franchise beyond the Skywalkers, let us all remember who Anakin really way here. Looking forward to Episode 9",,,,,
50,bad,"  LOVED IT. I want to see it again. The filmmakers said many times that this movie is a turning point for the saga to move on with new characters and situations. I personally want the old crew and fun back, and am a little war-weary, but hey I'm a traditionalist in many ways ... but able to embrace change. Still, I wish for the eye and ear candy surprises of warming up inside an animal... the bar scene, Old Ben being cheeky with stormtroopers, the enormously villainous Darth Vader, and all the old Skywalker magic. I miss it! So, I battle on with the saga and enjoy it, with some regrets.",,,,,
50,bad,  Loved it. Not what I expected at all.,,,,,
50,bad,"  Not sure where all the hate is coming from, really good movie and definitely better than the paint by numbers star wars that was episode 7",,,,,
50,bad,  Phenomenal! Best movie of the franchise,,,,,
50,bad,"  Rian Johnson takes the ""Star Wars"" universe and injects depth and gravitas in ways I didn't expect. The low audience scores are clearly fanboys who didn't get the story the wanted. If they would just get past their shallow disappointment, they would see a rich and satisfying story that is awesome in its unexpected-ness.",,,,,
5,bad,  Rotten tomato gave 93% to this??? Loosing trust on critics!!!,,,,,
40,bad,  So much better than crappy Force Awakens.,,,,,
50,bad,  So of the most emotionally powerful scenes in Star Wars history.,,,,,
5,bad,"  So sad with this film. It's the worst of the saga. It's worse than Clone Wars. It's a fact that has some fantastic scenes and some marvelous moments. However, I'm so sad!!!",,,,,
5,bad,  Such a wasted opportunity. Terrible movie.,,,,,
5,bad,  Super disappointed after waiting such a long time for this movie and it turned out to be one of the worst.,,,,,
10,bad,"  Terrible movie, showing Disney's flaws and the amount of SJW influence. No respect for the source material. You ruined all the potential Disney. Shame on you.",,,,,
50,bad,"  The Last Jedi was a bold, refreshing ride in a galaxy far far away. I absolutely loved it! Let go of your expectations and enjoy the ride. This one won't go the way you think. I can't wait to see it again!",,,,,
25,bad,  The movie was ok. Nothing special. Made me dislike the character of Kylo Ren even more.,,,,,
30,bad,"  There was a lot I liked about the movie but a few things I cannot let go. First it was not Luke's time to perish. 2nd when Luke first held his lightsaber again, it should have brought back some epic memories in some sort of flashback scene. Luke would have always understood what turns a jedi to the dark side. He would never just give up on the jedi like he was portrayed. When yoda showed up, Luke should have showed more humility and reverence for his former master. It was almost like oh hey yoda... I also think the seriousness of the situation Anakin and Obi one should have been there with Yoda mentoring Luke. The movie was good, but not good enough for a true star wars fan.",,,,,
5,bad,  This film is a piece of shit. Rian Johnson simply destroyed Star Wars' legacy.,,,,,
10,bad,  This movie sucked. It's meant for children,,,,,
5,bad,  what a piece of #$#$#. even so it was better than the last one. do these people even understand that the ships have light speed? i'm done with these movies. i'm embarrassed for everyone evolved.,,,,,
50,bad,"  Very rewarding Star Wars movie,",,,,,
50,bad,  This movie was amazing--all of you whiners need to quit whining.,,,,,
20,bad,"  Visually the best Star Wars film. I just don't like Luke's portrayal, storyline, nor the lame force projection death at the end. I can nick pic other scenes like Leia flying through space and Admiral Ackbar's sudden no tribute death. BUT, OVERALL STILL A GREAT STAR WARS FILM! Damn you Rian Johnson!",,,,,
10,bad,  Was an ok film but a poor Star Wars. Lazy writing. Character development was poor.,,,,,
10,bad,  Way to many plot holes and totally rips apart everything force awakens did,,,,,
5,bad,  Worst Star Wars movie,,,,,
5,bad,This movie sucked. Total letdown.,,,,,
25,bad,very dissapointing for the star wars universe and the crap-tastic version of the Last Jedi.. I hope JJ Abrams fixes up this mess in 9..,,,,,
5,bad,Breaks my heart to say it. This movie was such a disappointment. Pretty much just ruined Star Wars for all fans. Completely ruined Luke Skywalker. Boring subplots. and NO LIGHTSABER DUELS.. ru kidding? Movie sucked,,,,,
40,bad,"I liked it a lot. I'm a SW fan but not a super fan. I never read any of the books or played the video games. This movie looked great, sounded amazing, had great acting, great action scenes and was funny. Perfect 5/7",,,,,
50,bad,"Let me preface my review by saying this; I loved this film to bits, and after leaving the theater for the first time I found very little to criticize. So when I saw the 55% of audience liked this film I was deeply shocked. That was until I read the audience reviews, and thats when I realized half the people wouldn't know a good movie, or a good star wars movie if it hit them in the face. If you want to see my thoughts on the movie that'll be further down, but I wanted to highlight some of the idiocy on display from my fellow movie viewers; and pick apart some of their criticisms with the film.",,,,,
10,bad,Disappointing garbage. The only thing this movie has on Episode 1 is no JarJar Binks character. I cannot decide if I rate it above or below Episode 1 as the worst Star Wars movie ever.,,,,,
20,bad,"If you are a not a Star Wars fan then this is your movie, go have fun, leave. If you are casual or more Star Wars fan then this is going to disappoint you. Too many plot holes, broken continuity, poor characters. The more I think about the movie the worse it gets. Help us JJ Abrams, you are our only hope?",,,,,
5,bad,Disgrace to the Star Wars series. Ditches the long term Star Wars community for general-public guardians of the galaxy-loving people.,,,,,
10,bad,Way too many plot holes... And pathetic ending to star wars greatest character... nothing made sense... a ship running out of fuel?? Lmaoo and a slow-mo Chase? Are you kidding... epic disappointment... by far the worst chapter,,,,,
5,bad,Really enjoyed the film.,,,,,
50,bad,"I made an account just to write a review of this movie. Best star wars movie, period. I don't get why people dislike it so much, character arcs made sense, the plot was alright, and I feel like they did almost everything right. You expect one thing and then BAM, NOPE. Awesome movie, old star wars fans will never be appeased no matter what. Nostalgia makes everything infinitely better, you wanted a star wars movie, this is what you got. Best use of my money in a very long time, absolutely worth the watch",,,,,
50,bad,"Amazing! So many surprises. Such good filmmaking and storytelling. This isn't inside baseball - it's not concerned with confirming people's reddit theories or making references that only the hard-core geeks will recognize. The galaxy is an open-ended story now, and anything can happen.",,,,,
10,bad,"This is the worst Star Wars film I've ever seen. Important details go unexplained, there are plot lines that are pointless that does not move the story forward, the main villain is weak both in the force and in character, there's a whole lot of goofiness that shouldn't be there (and people said jar jar binks was bad) and certain individuals become strong in the force with zero explanation as to how they got there with no training. I didn't like Episode 2 & 3 but this one was worse than those 2.",,,,,
10,bad,"There is a way to make a successful film without crapping on all the past work. If you want to undo the original plot of the trilogy, then make the new films 1000 years after ROTJ and not connected to the Skywalker lineage ... What you are doing now is just trashing on 30 years of history to sell tickets and invalidating the complete themes in Episodes 4-6.",,,,,
20,bad,Story doesn't make sense. It's like they just decided to ignore everything prior.,,,,,
5,bad,A major disappointment.,,,,,
50,bad,Great movie if you don't have sky high expectations of what you want the movie to be. Just go in with an open mind and you will enjoy it :),,,,,
10,bad,"I just don't understand... no really. Can you tell me the plot of this movie? I'll wait for you to try to explain to me but in the mean time I'll tell you that this movie sucks. So before I rant get to know me. I loved Star Wars and even in elementary i would talk about Star Wars. I have all the games and I dressed like earth Vader all through my childhood. So I love Star Wars with a passion. This movie destroyed my childhood. In the movie they explain things no one cares about and the real story they give you half a** answers like an example is snoke; who is he and where did he come from?
No we will just kill him and tell you in the books. What's kylo's motivation to do the things he does? Why does Luke die, Because he used the force? Is there a f***ing limit on the force now? They literally introduced a planet that was poorly added to the story and they will probably never use that planet. I think I'm the movie if they used commonsense, it would have been a 30 minute movie. They also ruined Luke (before he died in a stupid way) like an example would be when Rey walked up to him with his dads lightsaber. Like Luke would want to know where she got that and would ask questions. Nope he just throws the only thing of his father and half his life out for a quick laugh (it wasn't even funny) I would keep going but I think you get the point. Don't expect too see a Star Wars movie. Expect too see eye candy and a bad plot. Also I've seen it twice and it gets worse so my rating will be 3/10 just because the action that's it",,,,,
50,bad,"Loved it. Saw it Friday with my parents. My mom has only seen Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back, to her, it was meh. My dad and I have seen them all and saw Rogue One together as well. He and I loved it.The thing I loved most about it was seeing Carrie Fisher.I also liked the complexity of the relationships. Planning to see it again on the 25th and hoping to do the IMAX to see the difference (dad can't see 3D so we went for a more classic movie presentation) and to catch the things I missed in the first go around because I was too focused on seeing Carrie Fisher on the screen.One thing I can say to folks wanting to see it, this movie feels like it was written and directed by someone who loved Star Wars as a story. As an overall over arching storyline. This was written as if to fleshout something long dreamed or long played out in the head of a true fan of Star Wars (original 3). So, don't listen to the naysayers, instead, make up your own mind. I found it in keeping with the originals for storytelling.",,,,,
50,bad,"This is the Star Wars film that has the longest running time, answers pretty much all unanswered questions so far and also drops you straight in at the deep end. Fans of Star Wars will lap it up, for the rest of us it's still an engrossing and enjoyable ride. Bravo to the director for also trying to move in a new direction.",,,,,
40,bad,Good movie. It doesn't deserve all the vitriolic hate it's getting...,,,,,
20,bad,"Never took off....critics are wrong. Rian blew the opportunity to answer lots of questions set up by The Force Awakens and didn't. It's too bad, I had high hopes for this movie.",,,,,
5,bad,By far the worst Star Wars movie ever made. A complete con job. Franchise destroyed. Not even one light saber duel,,,,,
5,bad,Rian ruined star wars. I could've written a better story than this garbage.,,,,,
50,bad,"Loved it. Fantastic Storytelling, Visuals and Spectacle. Earns a unique place in the galaxy",,,,,
40,bad,Though it did have some poor humor and scenes that just didn't feel like they belonged or went anywhere. Overall this is a beautiful and emotional ride of a Star Wars film. A must see. But a must see twice.,,,,,
5,bad,the only way to fix this is for Episode 9 to open with Luke waking up and finding out The Last Jedi was all a dream...,,,,,
5,bad,the only way to fix this is for Episode 9 to open with Luke waking up and finding out The Last Jedi was all a dream...,,,,,
45,bad,"""This isn't going to go the way you think"" Luke said. And he's right. And the result is -- rather than a story that ""rhymes"" so much we don't get anything new, we got familiar settings with completely different circumstances. To me, Star Wars has been life at times. You know what doesn't go the way you think? Life. RIan did really well.",,,,,
5,bad,"Genuinely Bad. Space gravity wouldn't arc energy cannon blasts, and the energy of said blast wouldn't dissipate over the vacuum of space. This makes the whole premise flawed to begin with. The Finn story is just god awful, and managed to make a fancy star wars casino agrivating. Also, the film seems to play politics a bit with the personification of corporate greed. Just unnecessary. Also the interaction between the Pink haired Lady, Poe and PL was very dumb.",,,,,
5,bad,Silver lining: coolest lightsaber battle ever. Ray/kylo are awesome together.,,,,,
5,bad,Worst Star Wars yet. They should be paying people to sit through this garbage.,,,,,
5,bad,Love it so much! best movie of 2017!,,,,,
5,bad,The movie was really good...my kids and I loved it!,,,,,
50,bad,"This is a great film! Mark Hamill turns in the performance of his career. The imagery is wonderful, a solid story, well told. There seem to be a lot of people who are miffed because Rian Johnson didn't give them the movie they had already made up in their own heads. Don't listen to them. Just watch the movie for what it is - and be happy!",,,,,
5,bad,unwatchable garbage. offensively bad.,,,,,
30,bad,As a huge Star Wars that loves the mythology that Lucas created I was a bit disappointment with this outing. It still had a lot good. It was entertaining and visually appealing. But I can't help to feel something was missing. The force was not with this movie.,,,,,
10,good,  A complete disappointment. Pessimism and defeat is not supposed to be the message of Star Wars. I'd say the series has now jumped the shark but it's more apt to say it milked the space walrus.Bummer!,,,,,
20,good,  A complete waste of its ingredients. Everything was there for this to be a good film and yet it gets it wrong over and over and over and over and over again. Seeing such high praise in critical reviews is stunning to me. No other film would have gotten such an easy ride whilst containing so many plot and pacing issues.,,,,,
50,good,"  A richly layered piece of storytelling that properly takes its time to develop characters yet moves us right long through deft twists after surprising turns. I was fully satisfied with the answers to the questions left by TFA ... especially Rey's parentage. The resolution of which makes her even more remarkable. Have already seen this one twice on the opening weekend and will be back, again and again, to catch what I missed on the first go. Have been Jedi Ready since day one: May 25, 1977 ... bring on Episode iX ... and I hope it is just as surprising and deeply satisfying.",,,,,
5,good,"  A star for the music, effects and cinematography (but if you throw enough money at it, it's an expected outcome). No star for poorly written characters new and old. No star for huge plot holes throughout. *SPOILER* a one-dimensional space chase - 3 slightly faster ships vs a galaxy controlling empire - seriously I thought better of Rian Johnson (Looper was an okay time travel movie and just shows how lazy he's been with this one). No star for the pacing and humour that just doesn't work, it's not smart and a lot of it's out of character for the tone of scenes it's in. No star for this marvel-like money-making machine, where's my refund? This is not a finished or competent movie. EA/Disney destroyed Battlefront and now RJ/Disney have killed Star Wars. RIP",,,,,
5,good,"  Absolute filth, shame on disney for trying to push this drivel. Story and character motivations make no sense what so ever. This movie ruined star wars for me which i thought would be impossible after the abysmal force awakens. DO NOT GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",,,,,
50,good,  Action from the beginning to the end! One of the best ones!,,,,,
5,good,"  After waiting two years for the Last Jedi and buying my ticket on the day it came out, it is incredibly hard to write this review because I am honestly still in shock of how bad it was. The movie started out great but it soon came crashing down. I completely understand that Disney was trying to basically say that the old Star Wars universe and story are dead and that a new generation and story are born, but why would they do that in the MIDDLE of the trilogy and without answering any of the questions we've had for two years?! How in the world is JJ going to do Episode 9? Besides not answering any questions that die hard fans have been waiting to have answered for 2 years, there are tons of other things that make this movie cringe worthy. For one, the dialogue seemed like it was written with a crayon. I don't think most characters ever had sentences that were made up of more than 5 words. Also, I had no idea that the Star Wars universe was part of the Pokemon universe as well. Oh and Leia can magically fly through space and then come back to life? And we're just not gonna address that at all? It was a 2.5 hour long movie and literally nothing happened. A ship slowly being chased and running out of fuel for an hour and a half is not a plot. If I were an 8 year old kid who had never seen any Star Wars movie before it would have been great. But as a die hard Star Wars fan who has spent years of my life loving these characters, watching the movies hundreds of times, and buying merchandise, I am just plain sad. And now I don't even have faith in the Han Solo story, Episode 9, or any future Star Wars movie. Congrats, Disney... you killed my childhood.",,,,,
10,good,"  Almost as bad as the phantom menace, the whole film was rushed, the acting and dialog is stale the comedy was awkward and wrongly timed and the plots where overdone and reused.",,,,,
40,good,"  Any ""fan"" complaining about how stuff is missing from the books has not been paying attention because when Disney got control they released a statement that they were scrapping all cannon not in the official movies.While not a fan of this decision the fact is that it was made and it's done, and no amount of bitching about it is going to change that fact.Overall it is a ""Good"" Star Wars movie and well worth seeing on the big screen.",,,,,
10,good,"  Arguably the worst star wars film ever made, no plot, no character development, didn't further the story in any way. Terrible humour that didn't hit the mark and bad script writing. Such a shame after the force awakens which was a masterpiece in comparison to this pile of garbage. Feel sorry for the actors that had such trash to work with.",,,,,
5,good,  Awful movie start to finish. The storyline is ridiculous even for a star wars film. Parts of the film made absolutely no sense and the parts where u thought u were gonna get answers fall flat. I can't see how anyone could have enjoyed it,,,,,
5,good,"  Because of this movie, I won't be paying to see any more of the Disney-made Star Wars films in the future. The best parts of The Last Jedi are directly lifted out of The Empire Strikes back, and most of the original material here is either bland, or outright destroys the hopeful magic of the Skywalker clan in the previous films.",,,,,
50,good,  Best Star Wars film ever! The new trilogy is taking the Star Wars universe in a fantastic new direction and I love it!,,,,,
50,good,  Best Star Wars movie to date - and I'm NOT a new fan. The movie is just beautifully made while it manages to pay tribute to the old films while it cements the foundation for something entirely new.,,,,,
5,good,"  Butchered the star wars universe with plot holes, lackluster writing and by pushing a political agenda.",,,,,
20,good,"  Coming out of this movie I was extremely dissapointed. There are several good things in this movie but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. Rian Johnson takes all of what was set up in The Force Awakens and destroys it along with several plot holes. He ruins the story of Rey's parents (apparently they are just nobodies), we don't learn who Snoke is, the character of Luke is treated extremely bad, and Johnson gives us a unnecessary Finn and Rose side story that is cringe worthy. There is a really silly and laughable seen with Leia that may go down as one of the worst scenes in the history of Star Wars. Also why is there a fleet of star destroyers just shooting at one rebel ship when they can deploy all of their bombers and other ships after it? Why doesn't Admiral Holdo just tell Poe her plan to evacuate instead of just letting him mutiny against her? Perhaps one of the worst things is the new character of Rose, who apparently falls in love with Finn only hours after meeting him and she gives him one of the most cringe worthy kisses in a movie I've ever seen! And the whole point of her and Finn going on a side adventure has no point! The characterization of Luke Skywalker is a huge letdown in this movie and may be the biggest crime committed here. If they are going to kill him off anyway why not just have him show up in person at the end instead of a hologram? It is as if Rian Johnson just didn't care and basically screwed everything that was set up in The Force Awakens!Now there are several good things in this movie too. The acting is for the most part is good. There is a excellent fight scene with Kylo Ren and Rey where they fight Snoke's guards. The visuals and battles are amazing. I would say this movie had the potential to be great and it has alot of good things about it but ultimately the story direction Rian Johnson went with along with certain scenes ruins this movie for me. JJ Abrams has his hands full if he is going to be able to fix the mess this movie created with the storyline.",,,,,
10,good,"  Disney opera with bombastic special effects and lots of green screen, an annoying post-feminist heroine and plot holes as deep as the Mariana Trench - certainly NOT Star Wars. Utterly disappointing!",,,,,
35,good,"  For me this falls between Rogue One and The Force Awakens in terms of my Star Wars movie ranking. I really enjoyed TFA, and I was not particularly enthused with Rogue One. I had mixed feelings about this one. Which might have been Rian Johnson's goal, but while there are plenty of movie styles/genres I watch hoping to be challenged, Star Wars movies are not one of them. At the very least, it seems to thumb its nose at TFA, which is a weird decision to make, all things considered. It still has a lot to enjoy, but if your fondest memories are of the original trilogy and its themes, brace yourself for this.",,,,,
50,good,"  Glorious addition to the franchise that puts it back on track. Force Awaken seemed a light redux of the original, which I saw in theaters on release. ""The Last Jedi"" brings the magic back, and is a timely story line.",,,,,
25,good,"  Glorious visuals and good acting cannot save a painfully bad script. After the well received Rouge One, I had high hopes that the franchise could be brought back into the sun after the terrible prequel trilogy and the been-there-done-that of The Force Awakens, but it was not to be. The movie suffer from ham-fisted attempts at humor that fall flat and unintentionally laughably ridiculous scenes (yes Mary Poppins, I speak of you). After the throne room betrayal, it became clear that the movie was determined to use swerves rather than thoughtful storytelling to forward the plot. I half expected the whole thing to be just a dream by the end, and to my eye-rolling and incredulous disappointment it essentially was. Add to that a 30 minute videogame style quest that goes nowhere, a gleeful book burning Nazi Yoda (I understand the desire to start fresh, but that was a tad on-the-nose), and the marvelous build up of Luke as a hopeless figure only to have him change his mind for no real reason other than to have an epic showdown (another swerve) and had this been any other franchise, the critics would have panned the sloppy storytelling and inconsistencies.That being said, why did the critics give it such praise? Two possible reasons. 1) They graded on a curve. The Star Wars franchise has had some ups and downs (with the downs being rather dismal) and rather than view it as a standard movie, they said 'For a Star Wars movie, it wasn't that bad'. 2) Fear. Given Disney's rather draconian treatment of criticism lately, no one was willing to risk their wrath by calling a tent pole franchise a turd. Also, fear of the fanboy reaction to calling yet another Star Wars movie a poor job (which is ironic in hindsight)All the bad press in the world will not stop this movie from being a billion dollar juggernaut, but all the money it makes cannot force this movie into being good.",,,,,
50,good,"  Good fun with some nice character development, especially for Rey and Kylo Ren, who establish their position as central characters in the final trilogy. The porgs provide some comic relief without becoming annoying and the old geezers (Luke and Leia) blend great with the newcomers.",,,,,
45,good,  Great for the casual fan looking for entertainment. For die hard fans (which I am one) it will be the source of arguments for years to come.,,,,,
50,good,  Great movie if you don't go in with a lot of ideas about how you would want it to go. Keep an open mind. As a true fan i like that they are trying to take it somewhere new while honoring what was done,,,,,
5,good,"  Horrendous. A social justice nightmare. Every white male in the film was either incredibly incompetent or a nefarious/evil character. Star Wars: Episode IV was the first movie I saw as a child, it's incredibly sad what the franchise has become. RIP Star Wars",,,,,
5,good,  I can't believe how horribly stupid this plot was. And now there are articles about haters are using bots and scripts to lower the score? What?!?!? I'll never pay for Disney movies again. Why would I? Fans write better stories than this.,,,,,
5,good,"  I dont care if its long, as long as it is good. Lord of the Rings is long, but fantastic, and want more of it. This movie was boring, politically correct nonsense. It could have been great, but failed.",,,,,
45,good,  I enjoyed it. I'd see it again. Was it long at times? Sure. Are there some oddities with the fact that the Rebels are reduced to a handful of heroes trapped in a cave? Yes. But the movie falls right into place and sets up the rest of the story.,,,,,
20,good,"  I feel like a kid who waited 2 years for Christmas and just found a lump of coal in my stocking. I walked out of the Force Awakens feeling positively giddy, and left the Last Jedi feeling disappointed and a little depressed. The sub-plots were ridiculous and added nothing to the story, especially the casino scenes. I found myself rolling my eyes and had flashbacks to watching the prequels in certain spots. It was great to see Luke, and I loved Mark's performance, but I cant understand why, if they wanted to sacrifice another hero, they didn't write Leah's death into the script instead of Lukes. With all 3 original stars gone, I fear for the next installment. There were some nice scenes with Kilo and Rey, but all in all, too many plot holes, un-answered questions, unnecessary characters and just bad storytelling. So disappointing after the Force Awakens terrific start to the series.",,,,,
5,good,"  I gave this half a star because it has ""Star Wars"" in the title. Otherwise it was trash.This movie has no original plot.The franchise doesn't have a coherent story anymore. It treats the audience like it's incredibly stupid by clubbing the audience with overblown rhetoric, over the top villains and repeating the word ""Hope!"" over and over again as if we missed it the first time.The Force is now just a galactic cheat code allowing the most random people to do incredible miracles with absolutely no training whatever. Instead of allowing the Force to remain the elegant mystery described by Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back they're just using it as a tool to sell toy light sabers to every kid in the world because, you know, anyone can use the Force like a god now.I couldn't care less about any of the new characters although I would pay money to watch Po die horribly.Luke is in turmoil but his father and his first teacher (Anakin and Obi Wan) don't even check in with him?The message to the audience is clear. All of those who have been fans since 1977 should fade into the background with Luke Skywalker because the Star Wars universe you knew is gone and not coming back. Its all about selling Micky Mouse Light sabers and Disney Star Wars cruises. No one is interested in telling a story; not even a bad story. So next time don't insult the world and just put up a 15 minute light saber battle, have another Death Star blow up, have someone yell ""Hope!"" and then let the new space puffins dance around the Millennium Falcon to the strains of the Star Wars theme. A movie only a fanboy could love.",,,,,
5,good,"  I had to add an account on Rotten Tomatoes just so I can review this movie. People and Critics who say this was a good movie were either paid off or they have a family member that works for Disney or on the production of the film. As a science fiction film it there are so many plot holes pointless story arcs and fantasy that goes beyond the bedrock of a science fiction film. As a star wars movie Rian Johnson and Disney are clearly marking their territory, like a dog urinating on a tree. They dissolve any nostalgia of the OT and anything they built up in the Force Awakens. I don't care if you want to take it your own direction but don't call it star wars. this film franchise is lying to its fan base and Lukes statement in the trailers ""This is not going to end the way you think!"" is spot for the entire film and for the rest of the star wars franchise. Bottom line, its an ok film and a god awful star wars anything.",,,,,
30,good,"  I have seen most Star Wars film multiple times, but I don't think I'll bother again with this one. The plot has MASSIVE holes in it (no spoiler comments here), some of the characters are really poorly developed / unnecessary, scenes (as another reviewer noted) are not needed / confuse things, and no, gravity doesn't happen in space, which negates a crucial 10 minutes of the film (so, a little bit of spoiling here). My family and I - wife and 2 sons - all walked out with ""meh"" as our review, and each from different perspectives. If we add up all our ""mehs"", we probably would give it 2 stars, except that it's Star Wars, and the CGI is outrageously incredible. The effects get 5 stars, the plot, character development, and unnecessary / ridiculous scenes get 2 stars. I can't recommend it to anyone other than Star Wars fans.",,,,,
30,good,"  I have so many things to say, but I'll say this: Effects and the porgs were great. The story lines were disappointing and weird in so many ways especially those surrounding Luke and Leia, which I may add was the reason most people went to see the movie in the first place.",,,,,
20,good,"  I left TFA in a nostalgic trance that allowed me to forgive it's obvious holes and shameless copying. Yes TFA played it safe and many dismiss the film for it but it did so to avoid what TLJ has arguably now done- soil a cherished franchise. I left TLJ melancholy. It tosses compelling new plots so subtly introduced by Abrams and replaces them with either nothing or something far more convoluted. It alienated itself from the rest of the franchise nearly as much as Rogue One did (the difference being Rogue One was meant to). In regards to cinematography, the film visually delivers. Despite the frustrating nature of the casino subplot in its entirety, it was one of few instances of homage to original fanatical settings. Unfortunately my main quibble is what this film represents for the franchise as a whole. It's the Disney-fication of Star Wars. Such cutesy, infuriating humour. Shameless plugs for young viewers (think the owl/puffin things). The franchise faces a serious identity crisis.. can you simultaneously have a supposedly darker film with lightcore gore and deeper moral considerations while still diluting itself with the cheek and cuteness?Is it brave to deliver not just what fans want and expect? Sure, but I think it still fell flat. Abrams has some serious damage control to do for the finale to the new trilogy. In summary- a decent standalone film on its merits, albeit with serious plot holes and dialogue flaws. The kiddos will like it in a classic sci-fi cinematography sense. As a Star Wars film, I think many generational faithful will feel cheated, as I do.",,,,,
25,good,"  I saw TLJ. I really feel disappointed. I didn't like much about this movie: Leia flying through the air, Rose/Finn story line, Rey and Kylo talking to each other even though they were planets away, Luke in a way giving up, the editing was chopping. I wasn't a fan of the purple haired character. I didn't really like the silly plot of running out of fuel. Overall, I liked the original trilogy. I had problems with the prequels, but they were decent in many respects. I really like TFA, and I loved Rogue One, so I was excited to see TLJ. But I'm quite disappointed in it! :(",,,,,
50,good,"  I think that this is one of the best films of the whole movie. Although the film has moments where it becomes weaker, BUT it can be forgiven if you consider the film as a whole. A smart movie!",,,,,
35,good,  I thought the film was good however I thought for the 2nd film of a trilogy the story was to fast because it should have shown and told us more about snoke and luke and not tried to rush both Ben solo and rey's storyline so fast this movie would have made a better 3rd film than 2nd that's why I believe fans are mixed about the film and is why it's going to be hard for the next film of this trilogy to get a good story going.,,,,,
20,good,"  I understand the ""out with the old and in with the new."" Just didn't like the transition. Did we as fans build Snoke up? Snoke scene total let down. Would preferred a different direction for Luke. Again understand he has to pass the torch just didnt work for me. Since we have never seen Liea use any force powers I find it strange how powerful she must be to have survived exposure to space and to ""fly"" in space. Always cool to see Yoda!",,,,,
5,good,"  If you actually thought this was a good Star Wars film then you're not an actual fan of the franchise and you don't know some of the most basic points to the Star Wars story. For Rey not to be of the Skywalker bloodline (and yes, I dont care that this is spoiled because it's a pretty rotten point and should be spoiled IMO) does not make a whole lot of sense when taking her unprecedented connection to the force into account. What seemed to take place was the fan base had a good idea that Rey was of Skywalker blood, and that Snoke may have been Darth Plagueis, and these may have in fact been where the story was going when we heard the franchise was getting another trilogy. However, these things were stripped for the sake of dodging predictability. Both of these ideas are miles ahead of what actually took place: Snoke is no one, and Rey is no one. You didn't even try to put any depth into this plot, Rian Johnson. This was 2 and a half hours of social justice propaganda. ""Rey, a woman from nothing, can do absolutely everything"" even if it means destroying the greatest film franchise humanity has ever known. Thanks, you **** ****",,,,,
30,good,"  If you don't think too deeply about the plot, characterizations, and all the foundation laid down in the previous 8 Star Wars movies and cartoons, then you could ay this it is an enjoyable roller coaster ride and 5 stars.However if you are a critically thinking Star Wars fan, then you may well be aware of the following issues and why 3 or even 2 stars is a generous rating due to continuity problems and sloppy writing. {Spoilers ahead}.1. If the First Order is sizeable enough to do mop up operations across the galaxy as said in the opening crawl, they lacked a second fleet to basically intercept and pincer move a weak resistance fleet. 2. In TFA they introduced force powers that could freeze a laser beam in mid air while slso engaging in force choking and other force acts. Yet, Leia could not freeze the shot going to the bridge thereby saving Ackbar and the rest and Snoke could not bend the blade of the saber before suffering a mortal wound. 3. Why is the Last Jedi more concerned, in terms of movie run time, with finding a code breaker to end this slow speed chase than, oh I don't know...explaining force sensitivity and being a Jedi with more than one line ""Jedi's don't own the force""? 4. Where is the Knights of Ren in this movie, even in the flashbacks of the destruction of the Jedi Temple, since they were supposedly there according to TFA? I had to look up after the movie just to make sure the Praetorian Guard was not the Knights of Ren in better outfits. 5. I expected Luke or Yoda to at least explain the existence of Snoke or at least make reference to the Sith rule of two being another bit of hubris or lies the Jedi bought into. Considering the simultaneous existence of Maul, Dooku, and Grevious, as well as Vader, the Inquisitors, and Spider Maul, as well as the era with Snoke, Kylo, and the rest of the Knights of Ren, the rule of two for Sith is not even a suggestion for Lucas, never mind Disney.6. If Darth Maul could survive being chopped in half according to Star Wars canon, a) why was Kylo not aware of that? b) how weak is Snoke that a Sith apprentice could survive what a master could not?7. If Luke was so convinced he could turn his father back to the light after the death of millions at his hand, why was he so convinced of his inability to turn a dark leaning apprentice back to the light, who did nothing really bad at that point, but instead need to murder him by light saber rather than force choking in his sleep or focusing on turning him back, like he did with his more powerful Daddy? Is it an old Jedi adage that you can't turn back your own fallen apprentice that's at play here?8. If Luke was going to help the resistance/Rebels, why didn't he hitch a ride in the Falcon and do his force projection at closer less straining range, so it might not kill him?9. Why would the rebels engineer a base with no known back door and why couldn't Leia or Kylo sense it but Luke and the crystal foxes could?10. If Hordo was such a good general, why not take one of the first cruisers and smash it into the First Order fleet at light speed and preserve the the rest of your fleet?11. Unless Rose is the last Jedi, why was more run time devoted to her plot than IDK than Luke or Rey, since either of them technically may be considered the last Jedi?This just points to some sloppy ass writing and poor continuity checks. If Disney still has Riann Johnson write the next trilogy, I will be skipping those if they are poorly plotted as this film.",,,,,
10,good,"  In The Force Awakens, Han angrily tells Finn, ""That's not how the Force works."" After watching The Last Jedi, I found myself similarly flabbergasted. Mary Poppins Leia, BB-8 slot coin machine gun and a Luke Skywalker who is more interested in showing Rey how he milks aliens than listening to her on why his own sister needs help from the son he helped drive to the dark side. When Obi Wan went into hiding it was for the purpose of one day training Luke to fox the mistakes he had been a part of. Luke went into hiding to allow those mistakes to fester into a new empire that is killing all those he loves. What a waste of a story.",,,,,
40,good,  Interesting storylines. But overall amazing. Needs a second or third viewing to catch all the nuances. Its not your average star wars.,,,,,
20,good,"  It had some visually great scenes, hands down. But that's pretty much it, the story just didn't seem right for a Star Wars movie, nothing seemed right to me, very disapointed in the plot, and for being such a long movie it felt kind of empty. Hoping they can make up for it in the next one.",,,,,
5,good,"  It was absolutely the worst Star Wars movie. I thought TFA was bad.. this goes beyond that. So many pointless scenes, horrible plots and what they did to Luke Skywalker is pretty painful for 30 to 50 year olds that helped keep this franchise so popular through the decades. Absolutely a punch in the stomach. Good riddance Disney and Star Wars. Don't care anymore.",,,,,
50,good,  It was not what I expected but it was a great movie . Resets the Star Wars universe and opens it up to new possibilities.,,,,,
5,good,"  It's not as bad as people say it is... It's far far worse. Not just a bad star wars movie, a bad movie period. Makes zero sense at every level, I don't even know where to start. Save your money and watch it when it airs on free TV... It's just crap.",,,,,
10,good,  like watching Spaceballs being turned into a Star wars movie. A progressive parody of what star wars used to be.,,,,,
5,good,  Liking this movie means you probably suffer from cognitive dissonance and let your love for the pre-Disney versions allow you to overlook major story flaws in this almost entirely new child like disjointed universe.,,,,,
50,good,  Loved the movie! Maybe my favorite from the whole saga at the same height of ESB. I really liked the way Rian Johnson took risks that pay off. I actually felt like the first time I watched ESB and after a second screening I loved to see children talking about how amazing the movie is. I ENJOYED Star Wars again.,,,,,
50,good,"  Loved the movie, it was inspiring and surprising. Loved the fact that they actually made the characters human and not flawless heroes, everyone can make a mistake. It's not a fairytale, let's leave them to the kids. Even the mighty Luke Skywalker get's scared and makes mistakes, and young heroes like Poe, Rey and Finn must grow up and learn before leading a rebellion. It's an actual movie, that gives a new perspective on the characters we love, and I as a Fan (with capital letters 'cause I saw the movies countless times and read some of the novels) appreciate it maybe more than the others. And for the riot that made also a petition to remake the movie, you should read again the books about the old trilogy (spoiler: Luke is very human and just a normal guy, not some flawless god).",,,,,
45,good,"  Loved the movie, thought it was a great story-line keeping to a successful formula for Star Wars of the good side not always being as victorious as you would hope, but enough to make progress against the evil.",,,,,
20,good,"  More silly and less focused than The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi offers many entertaining and dramatic moments but ultimately fails to be a Star Wars film or give its main characters any real substance to work with. They're continuing to do their best at writing these films without writing them and hoping the cinematography makes up for it. For many of us, it does not.",,,,,
25,good,"  Mostly the same story as ESB, just resequenced. Over the top humor and too mich of it. Has some great moments but not enough and a bad plot. Rogue One has set the bar and this falls miserably short. The best line is, ""You're no Vader, just a child in a mask."" That pretty much sums up Kylo and the rest of the movie....a big pretender.",,,,,
10,good,"  Movie ruined everything that The Force Awakens was building up to. Concepts from the original films have been ruined. Many questions people had from TFA were left unanswered or were extremely dissatisfying. As a film, it is good. However as a Star Wars film, it is awful.",,,,,
40,good,"  Not a perfect film, but after being disappointed by Force Awakens, this was utterly satisfying. It takes the franchise in new directions, while still feeling like Star Wars, through and through. I walked out of the theater re-experiencing the feeling of awe I had as a kid seeing A New Hope.",,,,,

5,good,"  Plot holes, mishandling of key star wars universe characters, poor new character and set introduction, poor writing. F-.",,,,,
50,good,"  Really enjoy watching this movie. Funny moments, excitement and emotional scene, all you need for Star wars fan are in this movie. Wow!!. I really love it.",,,,,
50,good,"  Really liked it. Rian Johnson made an epic. Really enjoyed how despite all the set up in the first film it didn't seem to matter in the second. Felt a little like game of thrones where we might see the origins of Snoke. Nope, doesn't matter. It's all about the kids. Loved it. Kept me enthralled.",,,,,
20,good,"  Slightly below average? Lots of slapstick for no reason what so ever. The constant ""we are all going to do, oh wait a miracle, oh never mind we are still all going to die"" pace gets old really quick. A movie does need that many moments of anxiety to be good. I liked Ren and Reys development but that was about it. Lukes death was silly, could have just as easily not been a meditating hologram and just had Ren actually kill him and that would have brought more meaning and purpose to it. It is pretty unbelievable that Snoke a seemingly 100 year old bad guy has only been using the force for 20 or so years (according to how sith work). His death didn't bother me like it did some. The movie over all just sort of fell flat. It has its good moments sure, but at least an hour of unneeded film that could have been replaced by substance.",,,,,
15,good,"  SPOILERS: So many plot holes that it's taken the enjoyment out of this movie for me. Where were the dreadnought's shields? If it's so easy to destroy large ships by jumping into light speed thru one, why has that not been done more? Why do ships not have auto pilot, or instruct a droid to fly the ship, why did Admiral Holdo have to go down with the ship? Wasn't Leia unconscious long enough in the void of space to have died before her force powers kicked in? Finn was the only target for AT-ATs, why did no one shot him when he was going for the cannon? How did he drag a body back to the base before the AT-ATs got there? Phasma was under used. The casino subplot really dragged the movie down and was so obviously pushing a political message that it was annoying and accomplished nothing besides introducing DJ who I'm assuming will be a bigger part of the next movie. Who is Snoke? Guess we'll never know... How was Ray so talented with the force and lightsaber with such little training, sure she got some with Luke this movie, but not much? Did not leave me on edge about what comes next. I will not be seeing the next installment.",,,,,
10,good,"  Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a disappointment. The introduction of a litany of new characters came at the expense of advancing the storylines of the sagas existing cast that moviegoers fell in love with in the The Force Awakens. Further, the development of the new cast felt half-witted. In the end, the movie failed to present any compelling case for why moviegoers should feel any emotional connection with any of the film's characters despite a 2.5 hour run time. It was clear that Hollywood's stances on today's gender and racial politics played a major part in the film's plot lines. While a lot of politically agnostic moviegoers tend to look past minor incidences of politically motivated screenplay, Star Wars: The Last Jedi took drastic steps to implement political motivations into the film. The most glaring example of these motivations is the interaction between Poe and Lauren Dern's character Amilyn Holdo. The narrative surrounding that interaction felt quite patronizing. There were several cliche moments in the film that even the prequel movies would have shied away from. The first installment of Disney's Star Wars reboot created high hopes for the second film. Unfortunately, Star Wars: The Last Jedi failed to live up to the expectations. I hope that in the third film has stronger character development and avoids delving into politically motivated screenplay.",,,,,
5,good,"  Terrible plot, lots of holes and inconsistencies. Diversity is clearly great and not a problem at all (as some point out). It's just a poorly written movie to grab your money.",,,,,
10,good,"  Terrible. Disney laughs in the face of the lore that has been built up over decades of Star Wars. The plot is paper thin, there's swearing, humour and jokes that shout Marvel and Dinsey, NOT Star Wars. It also features the most ridiculous Mary Poppins-esque scene ever to be included in the Star Wars universe. Sad times :(",,,,,
15,good,"  The force was not with this film. Some newer, and progressive fans may enjoy The Last Jedi, loyalists of the original trilogy are in for quite a disappointment. JJ Abrams was able to ride the forgiving wave of fan-nostalgia when Disney released his entry, Force Awakens in 2015. Sure, the plot seemed a bit too familiar, and a bit of a re-hash of things seen before. However, the story-telling potential with what was set-up in The Force Awakens was enough to forgive the lack of originality. 2 years on, the intriguing questions posed by The Force Awakens are poorly answered by The Last Jedi. Some of the biggest mysterious are poorly handled, and done so in a careless way...bucking audience expectations. Additionally, the problems with The Force Awakens are only magnified tremendously. Director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi borrows heavily from The Empire Strikes Back, but does so without any of the charm JJ Abrams brought to The Force Awakens. When the credits of this film roll you may be left wondering if the Star Wars powerhouse has finally run out of steam....or if the folks at Disney should really spend time creating an original story that stands independent of recycled plots, themes, and characters.",,,,,
25,good,"  The Last Jedi is 2 hours 30 minutes long and 20 minutes deep. The narrative is the spectacle of CGI. The suspension of disbelief falls short as so many major plot points deviate so drastically from the characters and world that Lucas established. The surprising twists are twists because they don't make sense or contradict established characterizations and lore. Some contradictions occur in the same film (shields, the vacuum of space, hyperdrive, the Force, etc.). As a science fiction movie, this is movie is better than some, worse than others. As a Star Wars movie, it does a disservice to the franchise.",,,,,
5,good,"  The plot holes. The irrelevant subplots that lead to nowhere. The insistence of comedic relief. Story telling at it's worst, and thats not even going into the way they handled the characters from the star wars universe",,,,,
10,good,"  The visuals were amazing and the sound engineering was great. Almost everything else about this movie made it hard to take seriously. The dialogue was stiff and strange, the plot was not engaging, and the movie lacked any form of serious conflict. The Last Jedi is a waste of 2.5 hours.",,,,,
25,good,"  They simply could have made this movie better. While decent, but still not better than Empire Strikes Back and, ironically, on par with Return of the Jedi. I simply don't understand the logic of a non-physical form Luke Skywalker going forward. We never got to see Luke Skywalker using a lightsaber as a true Jedi Master and using his full power in the Force. It leads me to ponder if the screenwriters or story writers have any clue about the saga of the Skywalker family.",,,,,
30,good,"  This is not the movie I wanted to see. Technically it was a beautifully shot movie, with a couple of homages to the Star Wars we all know and love(d). Wasteful, non-inspiring story. I understand the logic of why they did what they did with the Skywalker's in this movie, but it is sure to make fans upset. This movie has cured me of standing in line opening night for the latest Star Wars movie, which I have done since I was 5 years old when the original Star Wars A New Hope opened. I feel like the writer/director didn't care about the audience, and I felt my time was wasted on huge chunks of the movie that had nothing to do with the plot. I'll see the next movie, but I won't rush to see it.",,,,,
5,good,"  This movie completely annihilated a beloved franchise in the most agonizing 2hr33min of my life, and without the use of JarJar Binks, a feat I previously thought impossible. The only comfort for me is that at least now people won't say episodes 1-3 were bad, because they now have episode 8 to compare them to. This movie has turned one of the greatest characters into an alien milking maniac, had Princess Leia magically fly through space like an X-Wing, and had the all powerful Snoke get killed by a teen who lost a light saber battle to someone with zero training. Imagine every fans worst fears about Disney taking over the franchise. Multiply this by 10. This is what materialized on screen. When Kylo said ""let it die, kill it if you have to"" he was talking about the Star Wars legacy, and this movie unquestioningly satisfies this objective.",,,,,
5,good,  This movie was terrible and there was no plot and the acters suck sorry to say but Walt Disney only did this movie for the money that would come in bye the hard core fans and shit all over use what a pile of garbage sorry to say,,,,,
10,good,  This movie was terrible. Please get JJ Abrams back fast. On top of the plot holes people have brought up it was just cheesy. Sorry but Mark is not a good actor. Really bad. I understand why they didnt have him talk in the last one. That bad guy snoke looked like a cartoon character. The movie felt like a cartoon and it was long. There needs to be some elements of realism in these to get people other than 5 years olds engaged. Barf. I felt cheated watching this. Rian should make childrens movies for pixar or something and stay out of mythology.,,,,,
20,good,"  Too many of the political plot elements seemed more descriptive of Disney culture where political correct behavior is forced to prove a point that falls flat. More specifically the escape sequence. It was descriptive of a dysfunctional culture more like the Empire, errrrr Disney? I also didn't expect to see Mary Poppins. The place erupted in laughter including the 12 year old folks next to me. Finally, Luke went through fire to become a mature man (think Obi ...) yet he was made out to be a broken recluse swimming in vain regrets.",,,,,
15,good,"  Very uninteresting. They chickened out from perfect deaths for Leia and Finn. I don't give a crap about any of the characters. Captain Phasma was the only decent villain(quite good actually) but they only gave her like five minutes before having her die again. Where's Peter Cushing when you need him? The jokes were bad and out of place. Although there were some good moments, like the initial bombing run and the duel, The Last Jedi movie was a huge disappointment and a waste of thirteen dollars.",,,,,
15,good,  Visually impressive. Great performances. Horrible writing. I expected more from Rian Johnson and Disney.,,,,,
50,good,"  While there are some valid criticisms of this movie, it is overall an enjoyable movie worthy of the Star Wars name.",,,,,
10,good,  Who wrote such a bad script? Who filmed it so helplessly? Logically Sharknado makes much more sense then this b-movie.,,,,,
45,good,"  Without explicit spoilers, the thing I loved about this movie is that just when you are convinced you know what is going to happen, something else happens.. sometimes in multiple layers. This is the freshest Star Wars since episode VI. This one is going to just get better the more time we have with it.",,,,,
5,good,"  Worst Starwars movie of the ENTIRE series. EVERYTHING about Luke Skywalker is out of character. No, not fanboy Luke expectation's, but, Luke's CANON character. For example, Luke sees the light in Vader ""a man who kills children and entire planets"", but sees enough evil in Kylo to try and KILL HIM!?!",,,,,
5,good,"  Worst SW movie ever. Disney shit all over Luke's character in the hopes of raising Rey and Kylo. Kylo and Rey both suck. Way to kill SW Disney, nice job.",,,,,
45,good,"Star Wars The Last Jedi is one of the best Star Wars movies. It moves forward the story line, brings up new characters and characterizes the old ones from Episode VII. As all Star Wars movies it shows us new planets in galaxy and this is what makes the ship battles more interesting.",,,,,
20,good,"The biggest problem with this film is the plot holes. Regardless of how die hard fans and casual movie goers feel about star wars and its rich legacy and lore. There are too many plot holes to willingly suspend disbelief; which is quite an achievement for a film franchise set in space with a variety of alien characters and an all encompassing mystical energy. Characters make decisions that don't make sense Even to people that don't know the characters so well. There is an entire ""side quest "" sequence that's so self indulgent and non-sensical it massively detracts from other, more interesting drama that is happening elsewhere in the film. Another issue is a lot of the humour just lands flat. Out of (for example) 10 jokes, only 1 lands. It's nothing to do with the context of the jokes/ funny moments either; it's that the jokes are in and of themselves unfunny, and so only serves to further detract from any drama that was developing. Some character arcs are interesting and well thought Out, but it's not enough to save the movie from the arcs and development that are lazy and hacky. Certainly Dameron Poe's arc is uninteresting and stereotypical, and what was once a potentially interesting character now just feels like a tack on into the universe to make another ""loveable rogue"" character. Some of the action sequences are well executed and feel impressive against otherwise flat and lifeless moments. The last 1/3 of film almost saves the movie which goes to great lengths to avoid previously established ideas and contonuity; but tragically again plot holes throughout the last part of the film detract from a few otherwise good moments that were built up and well executed. Lukes final scenes certainly do enough to raise the stakes and cause goosebumps, but the action and plot going on around these impactful moments once again make them largely irrelevant. The score itself stands out as always but overall a few good moments aren't enough to save this mess of a movie which caused a significant amount of furrowed brows and audible ""what? How?"" During the screening I went to. Myself included. A disappointing addition to what was a promising start.",,,,,
5,good,"Mark Hamill was great, the script, not so much. The writer clearly has no understanding of the original characters, or he blatantly destroyed them to spite fans. This is Not My Luke Skywalker.",,,,,
5,good,"Worst Star Wars ever, second maybe to Attack of the Clones. Can't believe they messed this one up so badly. How can so many people involved in making the next installment of such an important franchise not see problems in this script...or in the rough cut... I have a loss for words. I'm just disappointed. They're not making these films for people who love a good story anymore. They're making them for children, which is exactly how every single character acts in the film. The subplots go nowhere, the tone is usually completely unfitting, characters like Finn, Rey, and Poe have virtually no character development, Luke is neither a hero nor a mentor character (he's just...sad), Laura Dern (playing Admiral Holdo) simply doesn't fit in the Star Wars universe - I'm sorry, several plot points previously set up in TFA are either flat out ignored/replaced/or summed up in very underwhelming-sweep-it-under-the-rug ways, there were jokes and words that don't feel like they would happen in the Star Wars universe (I mean ""godspeed"" and ""forte""? come on), and an entire CGI-heavy 'Casino Land' that seems like an irrelevant, subplot island of the worst kind, reminiscent of Pod Racing in TPM. So many more things... but over all, just awful. Even if I try to forget everything I know about Star Wars and then look at TLJ, I would almost consider it an okay Disney movie, but when reality hits and I consider the legacy that precedes it, TLJ is just a terrible embarrassment on the Star Wars family tree.",,,,,
2,good,"I have no problems with the changes made to what many consider Star Wars cannon. My problem was with the poor character development and pacing of the film. For example, new character Rose could have been completely replaced with DJ the code breaker (Del Toro's character) which would have set up the phase tech the rebels were using to escape on the pods and saved the entire casino/alien horse subplot. This subplot felt too rushed to be worthwhile and instead would have given the DJ character time to build up for a more exciting heist type feeling as they try to shut down the tracker and make his betrayal later feel like... actual betrayal. His charter was cool and unique but his motivations were sketchy to say the least. Help them escape prison, infiltrate the first order ship, and just to turn around and betray them. Why was he so willing to help in the first place? It didn't make logical sense. Also, what was the point of Rey going down the black hole and touching the black wall? What did that accomplish? I can guess, but it felt like they were trying to touch on the scene where Luck meets Vader in the swamp, but not nearly as clear or impactful. Another problem I had was after the struggle between the lightsaber and it explodes, it opens up on Kylo waking up and the General just saying ""oh yeah, she stole a ship and bolted."" Kind of like, ""yeah, we saw that she was making a break for it and was like, meh..."" Then, she just appears back on the Falcon? Way to choppy and lazy.",,,,,
5,good,"All you need to know about this film is that at one point, while all their friends are in terrible danger of dying and they've failed their mission, Rose and Finn take a saddle off of space horse and proclaim it was all worth it. Full of plot holes, forced comedy and cheesy gotcha moments.",,,,,
2,good,"The Last Jedi abandons every good storyline established in The Force Awakens and leaves avid Star Wars fans in a funk wondering ""what was that?"" Long held notions of the Force and the Jedi are seemingly mocked in an almost forced barrage of failed humor. The film was designed more as a commercial piece to stand on its own as an independent film rather than trying to fit into the storyline of the franchise. What we're left with is a mess that J.J. Abrams will have a uphill battle to overcome in Episode IV.",,,,,
2,good,"Visually we are getting spoiled with the awesome CGI. The story however is a disappointment. The new characters are great but the overall arc story has been bastardized by Disney's desire to keep making movies. Luke is the key character in all of this and his likability took a hit in this movie. This series was about the Skywalkers and now it feels like they don't care based on the character assassination. Why not end this the way it should have been ended and then move on to new stories. For example, I thought Rouge One was wonderful and it didn't cause any issues with the Skywalker saga. This was just wrong on so many levels.",,,,,

45,good,"Star Wars: The Last Jedi honors both the rich mythology and legacy of the franchise while also turning the Star Wars ""schematic"" on its head. This installment takes huge risks and challenges the viewer as well as open new doors for the future of the franchise. For better or worse, Star Wars has evolved.",,,,,
40,good,"I have gone through stages with this movie. First loving it then hating it now excepting it all within a few days of watching it. I can now say that this is a good star wars film but it does struggle with philosophy. I now however think that is the point. I believe this movie to be a deconstruction and about moving on. While at first it feels a bit like a slap in the face over time I get it. Han, Luke and Liea are not going to be around forever so their stories needed to be passed on. I think the best line comes from Del Toro to explain this film, ""I don't know maybe you are right."" That to me describes perfectly the conflict of this film, the struggle with the Jedi and the force, the difference between heroic sacrifice and suicide killing. While I think there were some mistakes or missteps I do believe this film deserves some praise.",,,,,
10,good,"I feel a disturbance in the force, and it's this movie. The only light saber fight is against . One really good fight scene would have at least somewhat saved the movie. Instead, we have Kylo and Rey, fighting faceless guards, and neither of them use any of their telekinesis powers.",,,,,
10,good,"Rotten Tomatoes ""critics"" are complete sell outs. There is NO WAY this mediocre Disney abomination can get 90+% rating and no one of those so called critics would raise a voice. Cookie cutter plot with cliche script and lifeless ""acting"" all around. Complete joke. Its an insult to the intelligence of the audience. There is exactly ONE scene that is not a complete overused cliche. They really need Christopher Nolan or some other real director to pick up the movie or just file it all with avengers and pirates BS.",,,,,
50,good,"This is the Star Wars movie we deserve. I was thrilled by The Force Awakens, by the new characters and the return of the old, but the storyline itself was boring. It felt like the Death Star was getting its third, stale outing and old characters had barely changed since we saw them last in Return of the Jedi. It was made by a fan too much in awe of his material. His love for the originals shone through, but it was an homage to The Empire Strikes Back rather than a fresh chapter where time has passed and characters have changed. In the end, it didn't matter too much, TFA was beautiful and I was won over from the second those yellow letters started to crawl up the screen.

So now to Rian Johnson's attempt at a Star Wars movie. There are so many reasons it is a success to me. Setting aside the new worlds, the new creatures (Porgs! Glitter critters!! Racegoatlynxes!!!) and the refreshing swathe of new characters played by women and people of colour (finally), at the core of this movie is it's attention to failure. Things go wrong. Characters mess up. Bad choices are made. Trust is betrayed, heroes disappoint, legends turn out to be an illusion. Things don't go the way you think. And yet there is hope. I am so glad that this hope doesn't stem from the Skywalker dynasty, that the message is that ordinary people, a rejected girl, the children of nobodies, can resist and lead and bring down empires.

In having his characters literally burn and destroy all that is familiar, Johnson destroys the safe, formulaic, Star Wars-by-numbers that JJ Abrams so lovingly created. The old ways are dead. What will become of this growing force between Rey & Kylo Ren? With The Last Jedi, Johnson has stripped away cliche and predictability. I have no idea what will happen in Episode IX. I am all the happier for that.",,,,,
45,good,"*CONTAIN'S SPOILERS*
Star Wars: The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, will, as Luke tells Rey, ""not go the way you think"". The Last Jedi begins straight after the end of the Force Awakens and it is immediately apparent that Rian's vision for the new Star Wars is being put on the big screen. This is the most ambitious film in the franchise to date, as it settles all the fan-theories that have strangled every Star Wars fan for the past two years, by simply scrapping them, and I seriously liked it. First and foremost, all the characters, bar Han Solo, return in this epic, action-packed and emotional film, including Rey, Finn, Poe, General Leia, and Kylo Ren. After appearing briefly at the end of the Force Awakens, we finally see Luke as the old, rugged and isolated Jedi, who simply does not want to go back to what it used to be, saying that ""it is time for the Jedi to end"". We are also introduced to a trio of new characters: Rose, a maintenance worker in the resistance; Vice Admiral Amilyn Holdo, a leading officer in the resistance; and DJ, a codebreaker and a thief. Each character, both old and new, have a shining moment, few, in particular, were visually stunning to watch, such as Kylo Ren slicing Snoke in half with Luke's lightsaber and Holdo sacrificing her own life for the escaping resistance ships by flying the command ship straight at the First Order fleet at lightspeed, silencing the film so the audience could stare in awe. The acting was the best that's ever been in a Star Wars movie, with Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa the highlights in that department. The action was spectacular, particularly as the Rey and Kylo team-up against Snoke and the rebels escaping the First Order fleet was panning out at the same time. The story arc of Rey, Kylo, and Luke was incredibly well done, with Rey planting herself as a powerful force user and Kylo apprehensive on his allegiance to the light and dark sides. The reveal of Rey's parentage I believe was very well done and came as no surprise to myself, but I'm am certain that many who were expecting something more grandiose will be dissatisfied. Admittedly, however, many Star Wars fans will find these revelations and events irritating and conflicting. One such being of Supreme Leader Snoke, who was simply a red-herring this whole time, and though his death was shocking, it was somewhat unwarranted that the Force Awakens painted him as the ultimate villain, similar to Emperor Palpatine, for then to be killed off. Despite this, the whole sequence of events spanning a short period time that led up to this moment was suspenseful and thrilling to watch, and the immediate team-up of Rey and Kylo, as well as the kamikaze of Holdo into the fleet, culminated in without a doubt, one of the greatest Star Wars moments. My other issues, some are nitpicky, include Captain Phasma, who was a wasted opportunity again, and will be known as the Boba Fett of the current trilogy; the Finn, Rose story arc was weak and the ensuing romance felt forced; how did Finn, Rose and Poe know to call Maz Kanata to find the codebreaker when only Finn had met her for barely a brief moment in the Force Awakens; and how did DJ know about the escaping rebel ships when they were captured. I know many found Leia's using the force to fly in space far-fetched (I initially found it weird), but knowing this was Carrie Fisher's last movie as Leia, it was a nice to see her using her force sensitive powers numerous times. My lowest point of the Last Jedi was Canto Bight. What was the point really? The entire plot to find the code-breaker was utterly pointless and eventuated in a total failure. It introduced nothing that was relevant to the rest of the main plot and in the end, they found a less qualified thief in Benicio del Toro's DJ. Overall, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, despite its weaknesses in some aspects, is one of the best in the franchise, equal second with a New Hope behind Empire Strikes Back, and where many of the negativity comes from maybe because it is the least like any Star Wars movie previously. Many of the complaints are fair, but the surprises that we were least expecting made this a far more thoughtful film and its ambitious take on the universe of Star Wars is a refreshing new step.",,,,,
15,good,"Is The Last Jedi worth watching once? Yes.Is The Last Jedi a worthy Star Wars canon movie? Hell no.I'll try to articulate my points.[Spoilers Below]Mark Hamill gives an excellent performance, and likely is the key that saved the film for me. While others hate what Luke Skywalker has become and does in the film, I am fine with the director choosing not to commit fan service with his character. Luke was a whiny, reactionary man in Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, and gave in to his emotions for a brief bit in Return of the Jedi, so I find his portrayal in the Last Jedi well within the bounds of his character. Only Rey, Luke, and Kylo's characters seem to have any depth to them. So much so that it almost feels like the director was annoyed he had to include any other characters. The plot decisions made echo the choices made by one who has no interest in anything that has happened before in this universe, and all but poops on every decision made and question invoked in the Force Awakens. For example: Kylo's cool helmet and voice? Get rid of it. Kylo's scar? Move it. Rey's parents? Answer it in passing.
Maz? Have a quick, mostly meaningless cameo.Finn? Invent a new character and send them away to spin their wheels. Poe? Give him one-dimensional dialogue to keep him busy until the next fight. Hux? Trivialize his competition with Kylo and turn him into a toady by the end of the film.
Phasma? Use her enough to include in the marketing, then get rid of her.
Snoke? Use him as a McGuffin, then get rid of him. Hyperspace? We can track that now and also use it to destroy entire Imperial fleets easily.
Kylo's torn insides? Yeah just kidding he's totally evil and one dimensional.
Miniature Death Star Laser? Has difficulty with 10 feet of metal. This was a movie made by a typical Hollywood director who didn't want to be constrained by any tradition or prior choices in the ongoing saga. The entire Finn arc seems to exist only so the director could show a boy grabbing a broom. The director seems so dumbfounded and unable to do anything with this ensemble of characters, that his instinct is just to reduce the extended cast to typical film tropes or eliminate the characters entirely. The plot and direction just seems rushed and lazy, with the exception of Luke's and Rey's arc. I'm not upset that this movie made a few bad choices. I'm upset that Star Wars is a saga that has traditionally been about lore and storybuilding. This movie is a cookiecutter blockbuster that really doesn't seem to care what came either before or what comes after it.",,,,,136
