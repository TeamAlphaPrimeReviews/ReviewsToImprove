Most instances of this are so jarring that they ruin the immersive cinema experience for any politically conscious viewer. Attacks on The One Percent - check. Attacks on capitalism - check. Attacks on animal sporting spectacles as a form of animal cruelty - check. Strong female character needlessly debasing a male hero, in a sign of feminist empowerment - check. Character made to feel guilty about eating meat - check. The clumsiest of all movie subplots is the vehicle for most of these checklist items, and could've been avoided entirely were it not for the aforementioned male hero debasement. Keeping the hero and the audience in the dark about the escape plan is lazy story telling at its worst.Despite Daisy Ridley doing an even better acting job this time round, the film ruined Rey's character - she had no significant character development beyond The Force Awakens and they removed the mystique behind her character with an innocuous line regarding her ordinary parentage. She's fought Kylo Ren to a stalemate twice now, and it seems any hope of an interesting development in their relationship has been quashed, as Snoke has been unceremoniously removed, and they're cemented as the leaders of their respective sides.Finn's character had so much potential, and that has been stripped as well. That you could've taken his character out of the film entirely, without influencing the outcome at all, demonstrates how pointless he has become. The ultimate noble sacrifice during the siege on the planet could have provided his character with some redemption, but even that had to be spoiled by the Rose character, in a selfish act of a affection, that had no reasonable basis in plot developments, and could have very easily led to the immediate destruction of the last remnants of the rebels.

Agenda?', '05'), ('  It\'s finally here-- The Last Jedi-- and after two years of waiting, it looks like we got a more than fulfilling result. The film picks up where The Force Awakens ended with Rey, Chewie and R2D2 on Achh-To with Luke and the rest of the Rebels trying to escape from the First Order. It echoes The Empire Strikes Back in some ways, one of them being that it\'s essentially a story about survival and defence, not attack. The stakes are set high and right from the first scene, we are plunged into action.The Dark Side, lead by Supreme Leader Snoke is shown getting stronger with each passing second and the Resistance is seen struggling to keep up their fight but hope is kept alive even in the toughest of times. Some early losses in the film set a somber tone and weaken the Resistance fairly, allowing the enemy to take advantage. But the Dark Side isn\'t perfectly focused either. With an inefficient General and a rather conflicted warrior at the face of it, their decisions don\'t always seem to be the best (as usual) but due to the sheer power they possess in this film in terms of artillery and manpower, the fight between the two sides makes for an exciting watch. Talking about conflict, we see it rising in the minds of almost all of the key characters in the film. The many different layers to everyone\'s psyche are explored and that\'s always something to love. Kylo, shown previously being torn between the Light and the Dark and having to carry the burden of being his own father\'s killer is more disturbed than ever and even Rey, tired of not knowing what her lineage is faces some moments of weakness. To add to this, the two are shown to be "connected" by the Force (the reason behind which is later explained) and this just increases the complications. In one rather cathartic scene, we see the possibility of redemption in Kylo but that is short lived and despite an inexplicable bond set up between the two characters, they resume their positions on opposite sides of the battlefield soon afterwards. Luke himself is an old and grumpy man with no interest in what is happening in the galaxy and it takes a fair amount of coaxing and our ever-so-cheeky R2D2, pulling a "cheap trick" in a really sweet throwback moment (you\'ll see), to get him to agree to train Rey. In a later scene, we see another character from the past, a Jedi Master whose name begins with the second last letter of the alphabet, make a small appearance and it warms our hearts to know that everyone and everything really is connected and those ties remain even after the physical selves cease to exist. However there remains a lot of tension in Luke\'s mind and a whole lot of back-and-forth about whether or not he should involve himself, even if indirectly, in the war again, takes place there. Haunted by what he believes is his failure as a master and his creation, Kylo Ren, he is never fully committed to what he is doing. We are told how Kylo Ren came to be and why he turned to the Dark. But in the end, Luke, very grandly and in a very unique way, regains his place as a Jedi hero.One of the dialogues in the film where he tells Rey that things are not going to go as planned runs true through every turn of this movie. Learning from The Force Awakens, this plot was created starkly different. Nothing seems to work out and nothing comes easy. The film has three parallel stories-- one with Luke and Rey, one with Finn and Rose Tico and the other with Poe and Leia trying to protect their army and the plans of all of these people fail when they needed to work the most. Even though it rendered the subplots practically useless and is one of the biggest reasons behind the big divide between the fans and the critics about how the film was (the fans disliking the movie, for a change), it\'s a take that I liked as it made the story seem more real because not everything goes according to plan in life. Rose is a new addition to the cast and is similar to Finn\'s character in that she too is an underdog who rises to glory through her will. Some other characters should have been given meatier roles like Maz Kanata and Captain Phasma, whose potentials weren\'t fully tapped. Hopefully the former shows up more strongly in Episode IX. One of the biggest questions from the previous installment was about Rey\'s parents. That is answered but it\'s not what was expected and even more frustratingly we don\'t know if it\'s completely true because we don\'t see anything play out in any scene, clearly, but instead just hear someone tell her about her family. I wish we\'d have been given more of a definite revelation, in this film, like the one from the "I am your father" scene from its twin in the original trilogy. If the answer is true however, it would make the \'force\' a more open power-- something that can be wielded by anyone and not just a special group of people.The film has been made funnier than the others in the saga but in just the right way and only when needed. After all, the events are very grave in nature and emotion rules stronger throughout. Since the story references the past more than The Force Awakens, it reminds us of what used to be and how the lives of the people we know have changed and those ignited memories create just the slightest tinge of nostalgia. Every time the Resistance takes a blow and boy do they take a lot of those, it hurts a bit more because it really does feel like we\'re losing a part of our family and the fact that the dashing Han Solo is missing doesn\'t help either. One such loss right at the end was especially heartbreaking. Star Wars just isn\'t Star Wars without some of the characters that have died recently but I guess that\'s life. Hopefully this person will return as a force-ghost in the last of this trilogy. The death was beautifully sentimental though as it mirrored one of the very first scenes we ever see of this character, symbolically closing the circle of life, so to speak.The Resistance is left lessened in number but \'reborn\' as Luke says in the end. Their future is uncertain but they are safe, for now, and the final showdown in Episode IX will be one for the ages.', '40'), ('  Star Wars - The Last Jedi (weakest Star Wars till date)Since the unexpected and supremely brilliant Force Awakens came out, I\'ve had really high expectations from the modern-day reincarnation of Star Wars. The Force Awakens relied on the nostalgia of The New Hope and it worked really well. Considering that dramatically Episode IV was so sorted, I think that this was the perfect way to re-introduce Star Wars to a modern audience. The follow-up off-spin too was great. It was deliberate, thoughtful but most importantly focused and not shying to dwell into drama. Within this context comes Star Wars - The Last Jedi. The Last Jedi, unfortunately, is a mess, though a technically brilliant mess but a mess nonetheless. I\'ll tackle the issues one by one. It\'s literally death by a thousand cuts for this film. It doesn\'t do things catastrophically wrong, but it screws up with many small but pivotal things at once. 1a) THE PLOT - or rather the lack of it. Like my brother stated, "jahan se shuru hoti hai, wahin pe khatam hoti hai", and I couldn\'t agree more. Characters don\'t move forward in any meaningful way. The plot too is pretty much non-existent. All it does it tie up some thread plots but there is a serious lack of forward momentum. Whereas, The Empire Strikes Back (the BEST Star Wars, period) ended with "I AM YOUR FATHER" moment, resulting in one of those 2nd in a trilogy film, which have a brilliant climax and yet sets the next one. The Last Jedi, however, does not have an end aim. The climax is non-existent, and the stakes just don\'t feel high enough. What exactly is the end-game? 1b) THE THREAD INVOLVING FINN AND ROSE (Spoilers) - So there is a full 30-35-minute thread dedicated to these two where they are tasked with infiltrating the Orders\' Main Ship and to disable it\'s tracking device. So far so good. They go to this planet, in order to find a hacker, have an elongated chase sequence, get the wrong guy, board the main ship, get caught and basically do nothing! So, you have 35+ minutes of screen time which literally adds nothing to the core story or fits in the larger schema of things. It only introduces the romance between Finn and Rose, some random liberal top1% propaganda, PETA animal cruelty campaign and that\'s basically about it. Considering the amount of time spent in the Force Awakens to establish Finn as a character, to him basically doing nothing meaningful in this film was a downer. 2) LACK OF DRAMA - The film had so much of dramatic potential, but the writers just squandered it. The film lacks a gut-punching scene or any scene which evokes some kind of an emotion. It\'s decently executed, but supremely generic. How does Rey realize her potential? The Empire Strikes Back had a whole sequence dedicated to Luke being stranded and figuring out how to master the force so that he can escape the planet and join the battle. His motivations are set, and his actions have agency, Luke goes through the struggle before becoming a master. Rey just does it, goes through no hardship, she just gets it! Her character too is supremely one dimensional. Poe aka new age Han Solo lacks any kind of personality. What The Last Jedi doesn\'t get is the fact that the original trilogy, not only played with archetypes (the rebel, the outlaw etc) but made sure that they were fitted with an equally charming personality. In this movie, however, everyone sans Luke lacks personality in their characters. They are just harbingers of actions with no purpose and nothing else in between. It\'s all too generic, the plot, the motivations, the set-pieces. 3) LACK OF HEROISM - The film deviates from its \'western\' roots to something which is well, universal as well as generic. You do get a feeling that this is more of a feminine film (female commanders/fighters all of a sudden), which is fine. But then (spoiler alert), fleeing instead of leading the charge and not doing something of consequence is not exactly I say \'dramatic\'. Where is the dramatic sacrifice (apart from one scene)? Where is the heroism? And the most heroic guy (Poe) gets reprimanded for it! Where is the risk-taking? And where is the audacity? There is a massive undertone of feminism and equal representation which is fine as long as it is not at odds with the well-being of the film. Give everyone a chance but not at the expense of the plot. It almost feels like a quota system with equal representation at work. Ok, so let\'s give our female lead a scene, follow it up with a scene of the black guy and mix him with a South-East Asian. Now, get the female queen and then the legendary Luke......rinse/repeat and everyone go out happy. As a result, what suffers are the characters. No one is given enough time to cook, no plot thread is taken to its logical conclusion. It\'s corporate flattening at its worst. This flattening strips the film with any kind of personality it could have possessed. Even the set-pieces are generic. It starts off well, but then you have your basic CGI powered, pretty looking scenes where people hurl swords and lasers at each other. Where is the dramatic action, the heroic moment equivalent of Luke firing the impossible shot to destroy Death Star or I am your Father moment? What is the setup of the action scene? Rogue One in this regard did a fantastic job of it. It had a plot, the end game, heroism, sacrifice and brilliant set pieces all in equal measure. The action here is devoid of drama and urgency. Even (SUPER DUPER SPOILER) Luke dies in a supremely uneventful way. Like C\'mon. Luke is Sci-Fi action hero incarnate. The destroyer of Death Star and Vader and you kill him like this? His death should have been bombastic, instead, it\'s a whimper. All he does is brood and milk lactating aliens :/ You just don\'t screw with the character of Luke Skywalker like this.... case closed. For Rey, what\'s her heroism? She can lift Rocks!! Great! She thinks she can change a bad boy in her own image, even better! As one of the viewers on Metacritic said, "Here\'s a stat for you... BB-8 kills more ppl in this film than Luke & Snoke combined lol! This is one of the worst Star Wars films ever!"4) KYLO REN - "Jhaatu hai yeh banda", I exclaimed as I saw n\'th number of his close-up shot. Seriously, this character is THE WEAKEST LINK in the film. Vader inspired dread, Skywalker inspired Heroism, this guy just inspires pity! All he does is sulk and cry and behave like a baby. How can this character be taken seriously let alone villainous? And here is the crux, the villains don\'t seem villainous enough. With these people at command, who will fear the Order? Kylo Ren is just pitiful. 5) MISPLACED HUMOR - Star Wars usually have had its share of humour. The banter between C3PO and R2D2, Han Solo\'s one-liners. But they were treated in an almost Shakespearean way, i.e. there were scenes set aside for comic relief. Here, unfortunately, jokes come at the most inopportune dramatic moment. Villains lose their power when their action ends in humour, or Luke his heroism when (spoiler) after being attacked from multiple Tie-Fighters and AT-Ts shrugs dust from his shoulders. It just kills the emotion. This technique is called \'BATHOS\' and just like most of the Marvel films sans Guardians, it doesn\'t work here as well. Too forced, stripping the dramatic moment of its efficacy. All in all, The Last Jedi is one of the weakest Star Wars movie. The amount of pivotal things it gets wrong is truly baffling. Random Left Wing propaganda and feminist undertones to literally everything were not required at all. That\'s not what you expect from a Star Wars film, especially when it has been preceded by the excellent Rogue One and The Force Awakens. The film is generic, too generic in fact. It was an excellent opportunity to take the series to a bold new direction, but unfortunately like Luke\'s X Wings in Empire Strikes Back, this film is stuck in a swamp. Hope the force is strong with the next instalment and I dare say with it possessing a bit more heroism and pathos. P.S. - The owl creatures are cute, but c\'mon, they gotta serve a purpose!', '05'), ('  I loved Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

Basically, they made the movie too long. I can\'t believe there can be an Episode 9 after this. The plot of The Last Jedi was poorly conceived. The story is like a rehash of "Return of the Jedi" but now it is 2 dozen people versus a galactic army. Nothing makes sense anymore.If there is a conclusion to be made about The Last Jedi, we have evidence that no one managing Star Wars has any idea or direction to go. When you want to make a trilogy, you should have a direction for all three films. If you don\'t have a direction for any sequels, then don\'t plan ahead saying there will be a trilogy.', '05'), ('  [SPOILER ALERT]: Believe it or not, the force is strong in this one! What I think is most appealing about this movie is the Character development. We find our main protagonist Rey and antagonist Kylo with big questions about their position in this galactic conflict. Their interactions and flirtation with ambivalence was presented during several scenes where they contact each other via the force. By the end of the film these two characters are tempted to change sides, but ended defining themselves as light and dark force users, respectively. Luke Skywalker, on the other hand, was turned apart about his role in the corruption and rise of Kylo Ren, therefore choses to die in solitude and in shame. Full of regret, we witness a sour version of the jolly character that Gen Xers learned to care and love in the original installments of the story. Luke resolves his internal conflict and realizes that he can\'t rescue Kylo Ren from his fate. Luke goes on and dies a hero\'s death, and lives up to his legendary status of savior of the galaxy after pulling one of the coolest Jedi Trick ever shown on the big screen. Finn and Rose were other characters that spends time in a side quest that was fruitless, and pointless some might add. From my perspective, this sub-arc allowed the introduction of character Rose, who was portrayed as intrepid woman that believes and venerates heroes, but grieves her heroic sister\'s death. On the other hand, coward Finn who attempted to dump the rebel forces during the beginning of the film, ended founding the courage that he lacked by attempting to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Yes, Finn tries to justify his actions as a selfless act to find Rei and protect her from the First Order, but come on, who many times did he tried to pull that stunt in the previous movie. I believe that in the end, Finn could find genuine courage on his own. Rose intervention in Finn\'s crazy stunt allow her to show how two people can grow together in the face of adversity. Poe also found himself almost castrated after his ship blows up and is demoted to Captain (and that kids, it\'s why nobody shared the original plan with him in the first place). Happy trigger Poe found himself in a vulnerable position that led him to make several mistakes during the film, e.g. sending Finn and Rose in a wild goose chase. At the end, Poe learned humility as he reflected on his flaws along with Leia. Characters like DJ and Snoke were flat characters in a way, but served to the story. Snoke offered extreme perspectives (going balls deep to the dark side of the force), while DJ\'s character represented the middle grounds and gray areas intrinsic to war. That said, the other aspect of this movie that really stands out is the "out with the old, in with the new" philosophy. Not only Kylo\'s character endorsed this philosophy after killing off his Supreme Leader, but is also the general sense in the movie. Scenes like force ghost Yoda burning the ancient tree, where supposedly the old texts were guarded, is other action that speaks to breaking old cycles to clear the way for new venues in the movie franchise. We got a lot of nostalgia from Episode XII, down to blowing up yet a "bigger Death Star." In this movie, Episode VIII offers an Anti-nostalgic, quasi-nihilistic attitude that most fans found offensive. An act of sacrilege that disrespected the legacy of previous installments some might say. Lots of people\'s hearts were broken during the process, because they hold dear old Star Wars movies. From my perspective, this makes this film even more important in the franchise, and will lead the way to even more exciting adventures in future films. It\'s safe to say that the original trilogy had a decent conclusion. Stories usually don\'t go on to the extent that we witness the fate of our heroes. This is what happens when we want more of a good thing. But Star Wars movies makes a lot of money. Adding to the saga in yet another trilogy calls for desperate measures to make more space for what is yet to come. Episode VIII allowed the character and the franchise to mature and extend for new generations. Hard as it maybe, the Star Wars audience wasn\'t ready to grow up like their movie did. I acknowledge that I always enjoyed a good Star Wars movie, but I\'m not a fan of the franchise. I almost always try to focus on the elements within a movie to appreciate its artistic values (not to say that I\'m totally objective on the subject, given that I think is almost impossible to anyone to have an objective review). I think that Last Jedi has a lot of merit from an artistic point of view, and that many will definitively enjoy the movie.', '50'), ('  Terrible. Barely any action, bad acting.

He was the humble young man that suffered great tragedy and hardship, but who through great heroism, friendship, mysticism and a harnessing of his innate gifts, triumphed over evil and brought about peace in the universe. He was a man that with Leia, Han, and others, inspired us, raised our spirits high above the mundane and taught us that good truly can overcome evil.Yeah, well, his efforts and his adventures were a waste of time. Han died, the universe was quickly reset right back to where it was, and Luke became a cynical misanthropic hermit suckling blue milk from the tit of a giant space walrus for breakfast on a desert planet.Basically that's what this film tells us.So why should we care about these characters, new and old? Even if they win, things will only going to be reset once again.All the things that the previous film teased us with - the mysteries, the unanswered questions - were left unanswered, killed off willy nilly, or relegated to pointless subplots in Casino prequel land. Instead, what was crammed down our throats was the message that women are better, men are fools, and that Star Wars is a bit of a joke anyway hence the self-parodying and endless misplaced gags.But the biggest crime of this film was to reassemble the original cast and not even give them a scene together. Yeah, yeah, Luke and Lea had 30 seconds of stilted dialogue at the end, but by that point we were so bludgeoned by insipidity for the 2.5 hour running time, all we cared about was when it would end so we could go to the toilet.The only thing this film had going for it were the special effects, art, costumes, a couple of poignant scenes and of course the music.

Incidentally, these same fans are probably the ones that complained about Force Awakens having a lack of change. Ergo, you really can't please fans. I personally see this as one of the best entries in Star Wars. I embrace the change to the status quo and the attempt to break the rules of Star Wars to enable a new order and a new line of characters to run with the story. I agree with Luke that it is time for the Jedi to end and this film does a spectacular job building up to the supposed end of the Jedi. Every character has some great on-screen moments. There's a scene I enjoy in regards to Leia, though it does feel like a bit of an ass-pull. The internal conflict within Kylo Ren makes up for his one-dimensional nature in the previous film. The good guys not all being on the same page to a point of conflict is actually cool to see. The bad guys, nearing the end, butting heads as they do makes me think there will be more conflict like that in the following film. Overall, this film does a lot to change this from your generic Star Wars to something on the level of Empire Strikes back, and I may personally like this better. I'm giving this a 5 because it is ludicrous for the audience score to be 55% when this film is among the best of the year and one of the best Star Wars flicks to date.

Dashed to pieces by the prequels.But this was something worse. The courage, the strength of the characters, the hard work of the characters in the first trilogy is just wiped away by this movie.Han died as a loser, cut down by his son (in the last movie). We are given no time to mourn in that movie. We had more of an emotional investment in him being frozen in Carbonite. That\'s when I knew things were going badly in this new trilogy.

Kyle loses a saber battle to Rey and the stormtrooper, when they have had no official training (force awakens issue). This issue is more an over complaint about character Handling. Fin is a boring character, and Rose was even worse. The movie would have been 100% better if that relationship and adventure to the casino critism of capitalism planet wasn't included. If holdo just told everyone her plan, that whole planet could have been avoided. There relationship and character building wasnt needed and felt extremely forced.

But that doesn't mean they are always right. For the given reasons below I don't think Star Wars Last Jedi is a great or good movie. I am going to tell you why Disney went on this route towards the end of this review. Let's begin! Luke Skywalker is marked as a washed of Jedi who has lost his way in the movie. He is merely there to be killed off and make way for other characters there is no significance with Luke Skywalker. Great Skywalker was sidelined and demoralized throughout the whole movie. only to be back towards the end of the movie to bie. There was no significant training from Luke Skywalker to Rey on Jedi training it was merely a Passover. Look how hard it was for Luke Skywalker to lift the X-Wing Fighter from the swamp but in this movie for Rey to lift huge rocks was a no brainier. That was no great Luke Skywalker moment for us to Remember by to show how powerful is Luke Skywalker. There is no emotional attachment to Rey to her parents and the discovery of who they are. After all that was the main quest on her side on the first movie. She gave it up. That would have been a much greater story. There was no great lightsaber battle in the end of the movie that we can speak off. That is a signature of the franchise.They have a lot of plot lines left unanswered and blank. Knights of the first order, exploring General Snoke's abilities and Rey's parents. Now anybody can be a Jedi, coming from nowhere you will be the greatest Jedi ever!.. I think this is a cultural effect where you can come from nowhere and you can be anyone in America. This is not necessarily A Bad Thing it doesn't fit with the overall arch of the Jedi Order. But in the context of Star wars it is better to have little mystery around it, on where and how the Jedi's become. Being feminist is good it is not a bad thing but when you're pushing for it you can almost see it through the movie. Female characters over the male characters again this is not a bad thing it is just when you are trying too hard to do it the movie fails. Why Disney sent on this route ? Movie is all about, out with the old and let's make a New trilogy. I am not talking about this trilogy, I'm talking about Disney's next trilogy after this.

There were some magical moments like reunion scenes i.e. Luke & R2, Chewie & Luke, Luke & Yoda (even though Yoda looked a little odd) that were genuine & heartfelt. "Some" of the humour was on point and hit the mark and there were moments of shear brilliance. The problem is there weren\'t enough of these moment and far too many moments of disappointment or just moments that felt - well "odd" which takes me to the negative "prepare to go into hyper-drive"The Negative:The Force Awakens was branded a rehash of previous films and yes even though I would agree at least the story was coherent and made sense, the character development was satisfying and it set things up perfectly in regards to paying respectful homage to the past and creating mystery for the future (for future films to address). Everything I have mentioned here The Last Jedi tries to either undermine or undo, I honestly feel The Last Jedi is a victim of trying to hard to be what it needs to be "Original" and "Unpredictable" and in trying so hard to be these things it falls flat on every single hurdle, so let me go into detail of what I thought was wrong with the movie.First off the Humour - The Force Awakens paid respectful homage to the original films in regards to recreating the humour recipe that those films created and carefully balanced the humour with serious moments. The Last Jedi literally tries to rewrite the rules with this, making it come across as a spoof or a piss take. The scene where Luke throws the saber over his shoulder could have been taken straight from an episode of the Simpson\'s, General Hux was turned into a bad stand up comedian repeating the same jokes over and over, which rather than funny comes across as very tedious in the end. Odd moments - There were a few really odd moments in TLJ, the one that springs to mind first and foremost is the character that should have been handled with so much care, because the actress is no longer with us. There were at least two moments in the movie in which could have been used to respectfully send off this character, but instead they decided to turn these ideal moments into a bit of a joke. The moment Princess Leia was quite literally turned into superman was such a strange moment and very awkward, an experience I have never had viewing a Star Wars movie. Not only did this make literally no sense at all considering Leia never had any Jedi training, it was such a disrespect to the character and talented actress whom is no longer with us. Luke milking a huge sea cow like walrus and drinking it, with a wink to the camera like it had been taken from an advert was again a scene that belonged in an episode of the Simpson\'s. Its moments like this that made me feel very uncomfortable as a viewer. Rey was one of the great characters developed in TFA, her character was developed really well by JJ Abraham\'s, she worked really well with the character Kylo Ren whom was consumed by evil but had a pull to the light side. She saw this character murder his own father in TFA, even referring to him as a monster in the previous movie yet in this movie she is getting all hot and bothered by seeing him with no top on - go figure!Incoherent story - The majority of this movie was one big chase and whilst some of it was entertaining from a visual / effects side of things it didn\'t make a great deal of sense. The little Maz Kanata snippet could have been taken straight from a video game, "you need to find the master code breaker to progress to the next level", its almost like they needed to include this character and couldn\'t come up with how to, so they did this just to include that character. And whilst the Canto Bite segment was in theory a great concept, the execution was all wrong and the entire scene felt like it was a completely different movie entirely, completely unnecessary and a waste of half an hour where this time could have been utilised developing other characters that so desperately needed it. The whole Finn and Rose romance thing was unengaging and did not resonate what so ever and Poe\'s character development was absolutely pointless.Poorly copied scenes from previous movies being conveyed as original - The scene on the new planet Crait was practically a copy of Hoth but being conveyed as original when its not, Hoth was a much longer scene and added impact to a very tense part of Empire. This scene in Last Jedi being towards to end of the movie rather than the begging does anything but this coming across as kids playing with toys as oppose to a proper convincing war like Empire conveyed.Unfulfilled promises and unsatisfying answers to questions - TFA set up things so well story wise ready for an eventual pay off in subsequent films. Snoke was such a powerful character and hinted at being probably one of the most villainous characters ever, even stating himself that he\'d been there from the very begging (before all the Star Wars movies). Yet he gets killed so simply that just makes you gasp and sigh in annoyance, almost like Tyson biting Holyfield\'s ear off and it abruptly and dissatisfyingly ending. Rey again such an important character in this new trilogy and it was set up so well in TFA in regards to her parentage mystery. She could have been a Skywalker, Solo, Kenobi, a descendant of the dark side or even an avatar kind of character being the chosen one "Vader" reborn. But no they decided to go with an overwhelming bombshell that topped any of these ideas - she is a little orphan mary sue with wino parents whom sold her for drug money, wow - never expected that! From an audience perspective these things are so disrespectful not just to the Star Wars heritage but comes across as a huge slap in the face, almost making it feel like Disney is laughing at us. Hints at things that were going to happen but never did - Rey\'s training barely happened yet we are lead to believe she is now a fully fledged Jedi by the end of the movie. Luke\'s training as short as it was in Empire felt like an eternity in comparison, Rey is obviously very powerful with the force with barely any training, yet we are still lead to believe she is a nobody - eh OK? Showing Luke\'s X-wing submerged makes no sense unless he was going to raise it up out of the water at some point during the movie, (which would have paid great homage to Empire) and use it to fly and save the day as Jedi Master Luke - but it never happened. Instead he decided to stay on his cosy little island and use his force abilities to project himself, yeah that\'s a better idea let\'s go with that one.Disrespect to the foundations laid down in previous films and disservice to fans - BB8 is the new R2-D2 that much is for certain, as much as I love the character it made no sense to bring R2-D2 back to life purely to give us the map to find Luke or to remind Luke of the good O\'l times, this was a disservice to the character originally created by Lucas. Everyone anticipated the return of Luke Skywalker, but the way they treated his character and the heritage of his character was a complete lack of respect. Luke was willing to sacrifice himself in order to bring his father (whom he\'d only known for 5 mins) back to the light side, yet we are lead to believe that this is the same character whom is willing to murder his own nephew whom he\'d been training for years all because he senses a little darkness in him? This makes literally no sense at all considering the characters development thus far and completely contradicts what\'s gone before.All in all an entertaining movie, but a hugely disappointing Star Wars Movie that does not deliver on anything that was promised or hinted at in the previous instalment and pays little to no respect to the overall Star Wars Legacy & Lore.Enjoy!!', '20'), ('  This film needs to be redone by JJ Abrams.

The movie uses a deft, resonant, metatextual script to tell a story about the indomitability of hope-of perseverance against both impossible expectations and the oppressive weight of almost certain failure. It's in both acknowledging and surviving failure, the movie insists, that we can transcend it, and it channels these concepts through the character of Luke Skywalker. Unlike Ben/Kylo, who is so deadened by his failings that he has become a sort of ultimate nihilist, Luke learns that inaction is just crippling as defeat; in choosing to reconnect with the force, Luke regains his sense of purpose and hope. At its heart, beneath the unfamiliar tone and uncomfortable character turns (burdened, it should be noted, by the narrative choices established in The Force Awakens), The Last Jedi is a call to arms-less a soap opera than a story about human frailty and the almost superhuman feat of carrying on.

This is total BS, of course. Not only does is making the good guys the underdogs again laughable given the events of the first trilogy, its a boring, safe choice.

Hire the team from Breaking Bad that would fix most of the story telling problems.Luke is back to his wimpy self, what was the Return of the Jedi all about. The hero's journey was wasted he learnt nothing but back to my point maybe it was never about Luke but about Darth Vader and now Kylo Ren. Lucky Yoda comes back as a force puppet ghost. He can now interact with life on earth and make lightning burn trees. So that is what OBI one was talking about when he said to Darth Vader strike me down and I become more powerful than you could possible imagine. Hope Luke can come back with some lightning action.Why did vice Admiral Holdo have it in for Poe she told everyone the plan before him? Poe is the number one pilot ok, so he got demoted, really. I guess fin and Rose would not have been in the movie otherwise. Lesson learnt from this one. If you're not going to tell a fly boy something his going to go by your back and stuff up your plan anyways so you might as well tell him the plan.Rey's new amazing force power now opens the way for anyone to have super amazing force powers just like picking up a broom and within weeks we just went from fine dining to eating at Macca's.

I knew, like any person, that this was a new series, under a new director. I wasn\'t blown away by The Force Awakens, but i was surprised to see it brought back that feeling, that Star Wars feeling. I\'d be lying if i said it didn\'t get me excited. I went to this film because i genuinely enjoyed The Force Awakens. I wanted to see it progress, to see the story unfold. My girlfriend bought me the tickets to the showing the day after opening day as my birthday gift at my request. We had to go to a smaller theater for the showing, as it was sold out nearly everywhere.If you enjoy Star Wars, and i mean if you have watched a Star Wars film- and know the names of the characters- Don\'t watch this. I\'m saying this because i care. Don\'t. Just walk away. Wait for the DVD. Watch it at a friend\'s house. If you even remotely care about Luke Skywalker- Walk away. Hamill warned the fans for months, and we didn\'t hear him. Just don\'t do it to yourself. And here- spoiler heavy, mind you- is why.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(Spoilers)---------------------------------------------------------------------------The movie opens with that epic shot we ended on in The Force Awakens. Luke, standing poised before Rey, her outstretched hand holding his lightsaber. Her quest to find Luke fulfilled, the map he left so he could be found, completed, and her epic journey to find him, fulfilled. Her face, Pleading. His face, grave and filled with indefinable emotion. The shot pans back and forth for a second, Luke grabs his lightsaber from her open hand, and hucks it over his shoulder and off a cliff.Noone in my theatre laughed. Seriously. I\'m not kidding. I love Star Wars, and i wish i was kidding, but i\'m not. And honestly, it should have been funny. But it wasn\'t. After two years of waiting, two years of building this epic moment. And this is the first scene. It progresses bewilderingly into Luke not only saying he did not want to be found- (Why did he then leave a trail and explicit instructions to find him?) into him refusing to train Rey. What we, as an audience, are meant to swallow, is that Luke not only left a trail ONLY a force user could follow- he also DID NOT WANT THAT TRAIL FOLLOWED.It cuts to a scene with Finn, waking up in a bacta suit. This is played for laughs, him walking around leaking fluid everywhere. But noone laughed. Again, i really wish i was joking or lying. I wanted to laugh. But something just wasn\'t funny about it.The film progresses to Poe- (The X-Wing fighter from TFA) Lining up with a single X-Wing vs several Imperial Star Destroyers. He attacks the Star Destroyer with no backup- somehow destroying every single turret on it- without them deploying any fighters- and none of the available other star destroyers providing any backup. It\'s pure nonsense as a tiny ship incapable of the firepower to even damage the enemy ships bewilderingly does so- and pulls it off. Whereas in the OT it took entire squadrons of X wings to destroy just the turrets- All of a sudden due to plot power, one X wing can take down a Destroyer. (And he\'s facing several)I gave up hope right here. I could already tell. From the stale lines pulled straight from a cheesy Sci-Fi channel original, to the bs space battle, and then right back to Rey training with Luke. Or should i say, not training with Luke. Watching Luke Milk an alien\'s massive crotch nipples while the alien moans suggestively and looks at Rey. Meanwhile, a space battle unfolds with the rebels where they drop bombs from a B-Wing in full gravity (In space, where there is no gravity), and from nowhere, at the last second, the Empire pulls a ship out that can predict hyperspace jumps.It only gets worse. The plot from here for the rebels consists of them running from the imperial battleships because they are outnumbered (But yet a single X Wing can take on three of them, and they have flight decks full of X-Wings) when they discover they are running out of gas. Let me just let that sink in. The Rebel ships are ahead, and stay ahead, because they are faster. The Empire states the rebels are just out of range of the cannons, but soon they will run out of fuel. Noone who made this movie understands how space works.Just to tutor you- In space, there is no gravity, and no air. No gravity and no air means very little resistance. That means, once you have achieved maximum velocity (like with a engine) you remain at that speed nearly indefinitely. That means, you don\'t need to use gas once you\'re at top speed. And at their top speed, they were faster than the Empire. Get the problem?They don\'t even need the fuel to stay ahead. And this is only one of the huge problems created by the lack of basic knowledge this film displays.During the battle, we see the expected death of Princess Leia. Because Carrie Fisher is dead. Noone would ever slight them for that. But in some ham fisted attempt to surprise the audience, instead, after being frozen solid in space- Leia not only lives- but force glides like Yondu from Guardians of the Galaxy, in a terribly cgi\'d flight- back into a ship that does not explosively decompress because plot armor. During this travesty of a space battle, Finn and a newcomer- Rose- are doing a comedy bit where Finn- apparently back to being a coward- is trying to escape the battle. She stuns him, travels to a planet to help him find support for their fuel lagged ships- (Groan) all while teaching him the values of animal rights and the evils of capital gain. Ironically, i\'m liberal, and these messages resonate with me. But in the film, they come off forced, ham fisted just like the rest of the plot. Additionally, it is revealed later that nothing they do actually impacts the battle, or any of the plot. And to top it off, Rose dies, killing herself to stop Finn from making what would have been an amazing and impactful sacrifice, and then revealing she fell in love with him during the several hours they knew each other with her last breath.This is disney romance at it\'s worst. Meanwhile, Luke offers Rey three lessons, because she won\'t leave. She accepts her first lesson, descends into a dark pit filled with the dark side of the force, and faces her trial.In what could have been an amazing moment of symbolism and a clarification of any one of the dozen mysteries surrounding Rey, we discover not only nothing- but less than. Whereas Luke left the tree aware of his great fear of becoming his father- Rey leaves with nothing. No lesson. No vision. No change. The theme of this movie, in short.As the climax of the star wars 5k funrun in space concludes, a character we don\'t know and i can\'t even remember the name of sacrifices herself in Admiral Ackbars cruiser (Him having died earlier in a moment of battle without merit), crashing it into the enemy cruisers to protect those fleeing the battle to a planet below. Throughout these scenes, interactions between Kylo and Rey have continued, through the form of Force Telepathy- a power never witnessed in the previous films, that it not explained in any way. As it continues to occur- and Kylo accidentally seduces her with his shirt off, rey decides from several conversations, the first of which she accuses him of being a murderous monster (Totally true), to the last where she bafflingly decides there is good in him, and ditches her training to go confront him in the same throne room as Snoke.In the midst of this- Luke confesses, and we finally get one tiny little bit of closure on one single plotline from TFA. And god damnit, it is the worst possible thing you could ever imagine for anyone who loves Luke. It turns out, the reason Kylo is evil, is because one night, as he slept, Luke Skywalker, man who stared Darth Vader in the face- Who saved a mass murderer\'s soul and returned him to the light- whose primary trait is his never-give-up, always hope, attitude and immense bravery- snuck up on him and stood above him with the equivalent of a dripping blade, considering his murder, because, and i quote "I sensed the dark side growing in him"Luke Skywalker- Child murderer.This is about the point i became outraged.The following scenes i barely paid attention to. I wanted out. I no longer wanted to see what happened, but i stayed long enough to watch Luke die, of concentrating too hard, as he used all of his abillity to project himself in a 5 second lightsaber fight that had no fighting- in the last ten minutes of the film.That\'s when i walked out. Happy birthday, me. And screw you, Rian Johnson.I am not coming back for any more. Star wars is dead for me. Thanks for the good run. I\'ve seen and read Hamill\'s comments on the matter- and i am going to take his advice.The original trilogy is enough- It\'s amazing- and i don\'t need more than that. Thank you Mr.Hamill. Your performance was the best you could do, and i thank you for it. For me, this is the end of the road. Jesus, Snoke. Where do i begin. Snoke, the man who can sense everything, even his own disciples urge to kill him, is fooled by a ruse that he is openly detecting as he detects it.

I will only be seeing The Last Jedi twice and that\'s only because I had tickets purchased for the second viewing in advance with a group of friends. (BTW this is my first RT review.)I\'ve never had such polarizing different opinions with critics as I do with this movie. I spent countless hours reading fan reviews and watching youtube reviews (positive and negative) and the problems that everyone has are consistent across the board. I\'m having a hard time understanding why this would be the best critically reviewed Star Wars movie when I feel this may be one of the worst produced... The filmmakers were more concerned with burning the past to build the future that they want. They don\'t care what the characters or story deserve. General flaws.- The plot and structure are flawed. The low-fuel resistance ship being "slowly" chased by the first order fleet who were just out of harms way presented no sense of urgency. It did not serve as a good ticking clock and it needed way to much exposition to explain what the filmmakers were trying so hard to set up.- The comedy was off putting and Star Wars should not have self-deprecating humor in the second act of a trilogy. Both audiences at packed theaters did not laugh at majority of the jokes. I actually was the only one laughing quit a few times. (I love the porgs.)- Luke Skywalker was not Luke Skywalker. I can write an essay on this one alone. His motives and arc in this movie made no sense on top of not remotely emulating who he spent 3 movies becoming. I\'ve heard many people express that they felt he was weak and passive. Mark Hamill was very open about not agreeing with how Luke was portrayed in the script.- Finn and Rose\'s storyline completely destroys the pacing and is inconsequential. This 30 to 40 minutes should have never been written or it should have been completely cut out of the movie. The filmmakers disrespect and kill off original characters or put them in the background, and do not continue to develop the great characters set up beautifully in Force Awakens. They instead decide to take us to Canto Bight to get preachy and repeat things we\'ve understood about the rebels and oppressors since A New Hope. (Why are they adding a love story with Rose and Finn when we just had the beautiful connection between Finn and Rey in FA?)- Snoke\'s fate and lack of any backstory were both unsatisfying and cheap. (It\'s like the filmmakers are trolling their fans.)- Rey\'s lineage was handled the same way as the latter. It was set up for us to wonder for two years only for the filmmakers to out smart us by saying "Tricked you! It\'s nothing!" I think most of the audience feels cheated and not wowed by this choice in story telling. This is not a twist or even a good example of misdirection. If you want to play with genre conventions do it in a new standalone movie by playing with it\'s genre conventions. Not in an established universe. And I\'m not saying we have to stick to the same thing over and over because I can make a long list of things they recycled in this movie. - The decision to surprise us with Leia using her force powers is going against what we\'ve known of her character for four decades. To use Carrie Fisher\'s untimely demise to trick us with Leia\'s fake death and resurrections that early in the movie was manipulative and cheap.- The Skywalker family is what this saga evolves around. If you want to make stories about Rose and Vice Admiral Holdo and their best girl friends do that in your spin off trilogy that I will not be seeing.- The theme of the movie "It\'s time to let old things die." So Yoda and Kylo Ren now share the same views? If the filmmakers are going to embrace this, let go of characters from the past in a respectful way.

In the original trilogy he was full of hope and optimism. Faced Darth Vader, his father, a Jedi given life by the Force itself. He willingly walked into the hands of the emperor for a chance to redeem his father, whom only he felt could be redeemed. In the last jedi, he is devoid of hope, and contemplates killing his nephew because he sensed a darkness in him. When Rey senses the darkness and gives herself to it willingly however, he tries to steer her in the right direction. Luke has now flip flopped from redeeming someone considered irredeemable, to contemplating killing his own flesh and blood, to trying to steer a complete stranger in the right direction. On the topic of things that don't make sense, Luke says he came here to die in self-imposed exile basically. So why did he leave a map so that he could be found? In return of the Jedi, Luke goes after Han to make amends for his failing to save him in Empire Strikes Back. In the last jedi, he decides that rather than fixing his mistake with Ben, that he'll just let Snoke have him and the rest of the galaxy. Worse, he knew all along that Snoke was trying to get his claws into Ben and did nothing. Then there's also Luke stating he has only sensed such raw power in one other. His nephew, Ben. So Luke sensed no raw power from Vader all those times before. Surely someone given life by the Force itself would be the greatest power Luke has ever sensed. And to top it off, Luke dies at the end in a way that seems both convenient and ridiculous. We are to believe that Luke just used up the last of the Force within him pulling off that illusion. That makes no sense if the Jedi's strength flows from the Force. At least according to Yoda...  Snoke was set up as the big bad. He was able to sense the exact moment any of his forces were defeated, anticipate friend and enemy alike, yet totally missed Kylo preparing to kill him. He sensed nothing! Kylo and Rey have a budding romance suddenly, which means Finn has to be removed from the picture. Enter Rose, who recently lost her sister and just happens to be an engineer who understands how the First Order is tracking the rebels. The two go on an adventure together where no sparks are apparent until she kisses him on Krayt. Suddenly he's lost all interest in Rey, because Rose kissed him. To top it off, their side mission was a waste of time. It literally accomplished nothing. It did not move the plot forward, and detracted from one of the best new characters. Rey continues to just watch a Force ability used once, or just thinks about it for literally a second, and she has suddenly mastered the ability. That's just lazy writing. Another thing that bothers me about Rey is her parents. I don't care if they were nobody special. Finding out who they were is what sparked her desire to go out in the galaxy. Do I need a name? No, but Rey might actually appreciate actually seeing their faces at least. This trilogy is meant to be a passing of the torch from one generation to the next. A great idea. Unfortunately, the only thing keeping Rey out in the universe is the identity of her parents, and making sure Finn is okay after his near death experience. Well, her parents were nobody and Finn is alive and well, so what motivates the character now? Please tell me it isn't because she's falling for bad boy Kylo Ren. If that's the case, then the next movie should be her giving herself to the Dark-Side. Also, according to the new rules, attacking your enemy in blind rage is the true spirit of a Jedi. Snoke pretty much said just that in this movie. So Yoda was wrong when he said a Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense; never for attack. This isn't fanboy service, this is the lore written by George Lucas, the man who created Star Wars. In order to help everyone understand what I mean by this, imagine playing a game, any game, where everyone follows the rules whenever they play. Then one day, 2 new people play the game, but refuse to obey the rules. In fact, they make them up as they go. Others not playing the game praise the newcomers for breaking the restrictive mold. You would understandably be upset. Because rules only mean something when everyone follows them. Otherwise they're just words. Speaking of Yoda, it was awesome to see him back! Right up to the point that he used Force Lightning to destroy the tree. If Yoda can do that, then the battle against the First Order will end within moments of the return of Luke Skywalker...Force ghost. When it happens all you reviewers who liked throwing the rules out the window should enjoy it!Captain Phasma was another character built up early on, but when she faces Finn, a lowly stormtrooper, he bests her a little too easily to be believable. If being a Jedi, or being with Rey isn't his story arc, then Phasma is. Now that he's bested her, why should anyone be concerned for Finn's safety? That also signifies the end of his most sensible story arc, which is sad because he's a great character with lots of potential. The chase seen in space was just ridiculous. The tie fighters could've been launched to dispatch the rebel ships in quick order. General Hux would rather just chase them, firing a salvo or two from time to time. Where is the imperial supremacy we should be seeing to justify the rebels concern?Leia floating through space to safety was a novel idea, but the camera shot made it look bad. It was a nice nod to her though, so I can overlook it. Poe was shown to be a fantastic pilot with a short fuse, but a lot of heart. He didn't get a lot of screen time, but what little time he did have seemed to move the character's arc forward better than anyone else. He was actually done well in the movie. I'm actually interested in this character's progression because of it.In closing, The Last Jedi had major plot holes in it. That would be forgivable if these plot holes coincided with everything else we were led to believe, but they don't. I felt the pacing dragged in places, and plot points were used to make later plot points acceptable. I find that unacceptable. I shouldn't have to accept useless plots designed to further another plot. I want these new character's to succeed, but as of the end of the second film their development has left me feeling uninterested in their futures. Did I want to see a god like Luke ans Snoke? In short, no. I wanted to see Snoke's story unravel, and Luke to be an older, wiser character I still recognized. I wanted to see him fulfill Yoda's dying request to pass on what he had learned. Luke surely wasn't making it out of these films alive, but there was still so much he had to impart to the others. Instead of that, we get two of the most interesting character's taken out Game of Thrones style. Visually the movie is Star Wars, and character's who weren't fleshed out enough. From a story aspect we were given something that seemed as though it was cobbled together to make a deadline rather than an extension of the Force Awakens. It didn't deliver on the hype. There wasn't even a real lightsaber battle either. The only thing as diverse as the Star Wars universe is its fan base, as evidenced in the many differing reviews of this film.

"This is not going to go the way you think" WOW was that the most accurate statement I have ever heard about this movie. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher were amazing and are legends, but Rian Johnson, Disney and the writers have an embarrassing view of Luke\'s character post Return of the Jedi. Disgraceful! Snoke was absolute garbage, a laughable character. This movie was slightly worse then the god awful Force Awakens, and the entire trilogy is falling flat on its face. Not to mention what a joke the lightsaber fight scenes were, did they train the cast to swing a lightsaber? Not to mention I guess you can now drop bombs in space through bomb bay doors, while a person is literally in the same room with an open door to space like its nothing without getting sucked into space? But when Leia is exposed to open space she gets sucked out, turns into a popsicle, and proceeds to fly around like Bette Midler in Hocus Pocus. When she makes it back to the ship and they open the door to let her in no one else gets sucked into space? OK! So stupid, what an embarrassment to this entire franchise. Just a mess of a movie and a disgrace to the entire Star Wars saga. Rian Johnson should be ashamed of this pump and dump movie only meant to make money, by luring in fans with go fish marketing under the guise and possibility of greatness that never arrives. Only to dump a trash rendition of a once great franchise right on our laps like a stain. We deserved better and I haven\'t felt this duped since the last M Night Shyamalan movie. Wish I could get my money back for this disgraceful TRASH! How many of these "critics" were paid by Disney to give raving reviews? The critic reviews are beyond suspect and some of the audience reviews sound like Disney employees trying to keep the rating up so they can cash in. Either that or they have no clue what they are talking about and their opinions have now become completely devalued, lacking any form of credibility. 93%!! Rotten Tomatoes is almost losing credibility on this one. The authentic audience reviews have spoken. Thank you Rian Johnson for ruining Star Wars and single handedly destroying one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time. If I could rate this movie lower then 1/2 star I would. I literally had to join this site to share my immense displeasure with this movie. Save your money, and wait till this D movie is on TBS. TERRIBLE! The movie was so bad that even Yoda at the end of the movie was ready to burn everything down.

We\'re expected to believe that a character messes up in not directing bombers we can barely see moving to return to their ship\'s hangar when at the same time we see that the ship they are meant to destroy is just a minute from blowing that ship out of the sky. This "failure" then spawns the 30 or 40worst minutes of the film simply because that character\'s leadership couldn\'t be bothered to sit down and have a 30 second conversation with him.The main drama of the film is an 18 hour long slow speed chase with three rebel ships barely outrunning a large fleet of star destroyers while slowly running out of fuel. Running out of fuel is something we\'ve never seen before in Star Wars and while lightspeed is, we don\'t actually see any of the much larger fleet simply jumping ahead of the rebel ships to cut them off or simply reaching out to any other ships of their First Order which the opening crawl tells us is in control of the galaxy and having them set up a space roadblock. Johnson\'s biggest sin here is in forcing the trilogy into yet another big baddies vs. the scrappy underdogs conflict as in the first trilogy. This is after JJ Abrams set him up by having the villains knock out the capital systems of the New Republic in the Force Awakens. Johnson simply ignores this. The hundreds or even thousands of systems that make up the body of the New Republic apparently don\'t seem to mind that their UN HQ system was destroyed and the resistance don\'t get so much as a phone call from anyone when they send out a distress signal as their chase draws to and end and they seek refuge.

It's clear since Disney has taken control of the franchise that Star Wars has just become a massive marketing engine to sell merchandise. They've also lowered the level of writing and dialogue to clearly appeal to the target audience of 6-13 y/o kids for all of the aforementioned merchandise. For example when Leia/Holdo (can't remember which) finally reveal the shuttle escape plan to Poe Dameron, he immediately repeats back the plan - this level of forced exposition makes for a terrible film and again is just catering to the Disney target audience.I can understand arguments that in order for the films to be made profitably, Disney needs to cater to the lowest common denominator.

The movie in itself was amazing but at the same time a huge disappointment, the forced humour, the choices of certain characters fate, unnecessary scenes etc, that\'s why I have mixed feeling and here are the reasons why I disliked TLJ:Snoke, (aka theoretical Darth Plagueis, that we shall now call Supreme Leader Snoke the unwise! - not that I wanted him to be Plagueis but it serves my point) is a character who\'s lived 1000s of years and seen the rise of the empire while hiding in outer rim. His experience in life left him scarred and weakened. How do we know this? From the Aftermath books, interviews and explanations from film directors etc. What have we learned about him in the movies until now? Nothing, nada. Will we learn anything further about him in the future, NO, COZ HE\'S F*****G DEAD!!! And if we ever had just a bit of information about him in ep.9, who\'d even care? The supposedly most powerful SW being died like s**t! The death was badass, but knowing who the character was supposed to be, what a waste my friends, what a waste!!! For those who only watch the movies, Snoke is a complete enigma. Phasma, the new Boba Fett, absolute s**t in ep.7, even knowing about her cowardly background from the comics and how she makes her choices to save herself first before thinking of the First Order doesn\'t help. "But do not worry, the character comes back more badass than ever in ep.8, you\'ll definitely learn to love her"... well hey, why not kill her off? Dies like s**t, big fail! No further comment. Please don\'t bring her back in ep.9, that would be the most stupid move!Benicio Del Toro\'s character, whatever his name is, you might as well take him out of the movie, absolutely useless! Why give a role like that to such an actor, f*****g disgrace! Finn and Rose don\'t even come for him in the first place, they just happen to be at the right place at the right time, dude opens the door cell like a can of coke (makes you wonder why he\'s even in there in the first place and why he didn\'t leave before), happens to stumble on bb8 and magically find their way back to Finn and Rose who are in the middle of nowhere, then it turns out he\'s exactly the kind of guy they need to infiltrate the Supremacy... Facepalm!Knights of Ren anyone? Where the f*** are they? Still no one knows. Will we actually ever know??? At least we now know they are fallen jedi apprentices but come on, why even bring them up in TFA in the first place if it isn\'t to have any visual content about them after? This better be fixed in ep.9 !Leia. Here i was hoping that they would\'ve given her a good and respectful death. She was close to death when in space though it would have been a pretty shitty death in that case, but at least Kylo wouldn\'t have been the one to trigger it. Don\'t get me wrong I loved seeing her use the force but f*** me dead, that angelic return to the ship was pathetic, she just got hit by missiles and torpedoes for crying out loud, not even a scar!? If you wanted to keep her alive, it would\'ve been so much more fitting to show her use some kind of force bubble shield to keep her inside the ship while protecting herself and even other possible crew member, RIP Ackbar! How can\'t they not let her go in peace? How the hell are they gonna deal with it in ep.9? OMG, why???Laura Dern as Holdo, nice move. Good to have an actress such as her in the movie. "Oh hey, I think we should get rid of her..." F*** OFF!Now see, this is probably one of the films biggest mistakes. Here was the perfect opportunity for Leia\'s end with an amazing sacrifice. Because when she dies in ep.9, who exactly is going to be worthy of taking her place or at least lead the resistance? Holdo for sure could\'ve been the one! I guess that\'s too late now, gonna have to bring in a new character, again...Letting characters live though they should die, killing characters though they should live! How can they trade in Luke\'s life for Leia\'s?!? No, i\'m sorry but no.That Ben Kenobi fading away death crap is not acceptable for that film and for Luke! He\'s the most powerful jedi dammit, isn\'t he? I get the fact that he must have felt exhausted after that crazy force apparition thing he did on Crait but dude, chill, take a nap, make some tea or something, get some rest, don\'t freaking die like this bro. If he had to die, it had to be in ep.9, not TLJ, period!Rey, oh boy. After TFA Daisy said the answer to her parentage was hiding in plain sight. The actress said she thought "a lot was answered in The Force Awakens,". It obviously wasn\'t the case. It was gonna be a big reveal in TLJ. It had to be! What, excuse me, say that again? Your parents are freaking scavengers? Are you outta ya MIND???

They wanted to mess with what we already had and loved instead of creating a whole new story from the start like they are about to do by giving Rian Johnson full control over a new trilogy.Disney can keep claiming wanting to please all Star Wars fans but it is clear that the aim is only targeted to new fan generations.', '20'), ("  I'm not giving this 5 stars because it was perfect.

When I saw the disparity between the glowing professional reviews and the damning fan reviews I expected to side with those who hated the film but in the end I thought the good FAR outweighed the bad. Yes, it suffered from lots of cringe inducing over-the-top moments, some generic Marvel-esque production values at points, and 45 minutes of distracting subplot, but it's core (the other 105 minutes which contained the major plot points) was magic, the simple and elegant story of Luke Skywalker and his two students, one representing momentous regrets and the other representing the possibility of redemption. A note about the depth of some people's dislike for this film:I hope that some of those who hated The Last Jedi are not so much reacting to the film's level of quality (though it's deeply imperfect) but more going through the stages of loss that the story itself intentionally and rightfully engenders: denial, anger, grief etc, and that some of these fans will end up changing their minds and having the deepest and most hard-won connection with this film (much the way I hated Return of the King at first for having Bilbo go senile and then later loved it as one of the few tales that recognizes and affirms the depth of life's imperfection). Sadly it's hard for stories that require long processing like this, to even exist in an age of test audiences and instant social media feedback. At any rate my fear is that from now on sequels might be dictated by the internet mob and that will be lame.So yeah, story-wise, The Last Jedi returned to the irrevocably forward moving and self questioning spirit of the original trilogy but in order to do so, it had to decisively depart from the spirit of both the prequels and The Force Awakens and I understand why that may have alienated some fans. I also understand why some would interpret the film's philosophical questioning of Star Wars past as SJW cultural vandalism given the deep tribal distrust that characterizes this decade (in 2017 when a character is tragically humbled we tend to take that as an attack on the character's demographic group rather than a statement about the human condition). But personally I thought the film's self questioning was very much in the spirit of the original trilogy and of good drama in general. It didn't ignore, undermine, or mock the message of earlier Star Wars films, it took it seriously and showed another side which makes Star Wars more whole.Some notes on me so you'll know whether my taste is relevant to your own: As I mentioned I'm a HUGE fan of the original trilogy. and I've been disappointed buy every single Star Wars movie since then.

Okay, maybe if this was a standalone movie, but it is not. It is part of a saga, that has been created a long time ago and has a rich lore. This story does no honor to Star Wars; it craps all over it and wipes it all away.I always made a big deal about Star Wars with my children. The Force Awakens was okay, I was willing to wait and see what they built into it because they had many possibilities with the plot points at the end of that movie: Rey\'s lineage, who is Snoke, what will happen with Luke, how will the galaxy fight the first order now that both sides are weakened, and more. Also, Rogue One was fantastic. But after this movie, unless I get my pants blown away by some magic, and with Rian Johnson at the helm I am not expecting it, the Star Wars series will be allowed to slide into a "to watch on DVD, if at all" movies.Let us simply start with the writing: Rian Johnson basically took all of the cool plot points from TFA and threw them out the window: Rey\'s mystery? Normal. Snoke? Powerful but easily defeated. Useless story arch about making a political point going to a casino planet? That absolutely had to be in there, why? Luke Skywalker basically being a non factor and then killed (Everyone wanted to be Luke, Han, or Leia when growing up, by the way). All the old characters are dead, and are now replaced with new characters that have little to no character development and depth. The coolest character is Kylo, but he is conflicted. There is no overwhelming, unstoppable bad guy (Vader and emperor types) because no matter what, Kylo gets beaten by Rey, who apparently can pick up training just by taking a crap. Also, all of a sudden, the first order took over everything because why? Didn\'t they just have their massive death weapon blown up at the end of TFA? So how did they go from that to all of a sudden they are everywhere? Also, Leia survives in space with some new Jedi power, when she has never been trained... how?!?! Would have worked well had they just let her die there since she is actually dead in real life! It was a powerful moment in the movie... but no.

Rey and Kilo scene in the throne room was great. But again, right there, Snoke.... Snoke basically is a magnificent villain. He is tossing Rey around, who has so much raw power, like she is a rag doll. Snoke should have been the unstoppable, fearsome power that is oppressing the good guys.

Kylo was a character so well played and well developed, and the interaction between him and Rey was great, and just what I would have liked to have seen. My issues with the film, though, especially being a star wars fan, left me leaving the cinema feeling ultimately disappointed. Firstly, this was a decent action/sci-fi movie, but it didn\'t really fit in with the rest of star wars in some fundamental ways. For instance, the humor was Marvel-esk, and it felt like star wars moulded into another francise - please note, movie producers, that not everyone loves your formulaic humor!! It is NOT a win-all formula that appeals to everyone!! Similarly, I do consider myself a socially progressive person but that does not mean that a movie should be a platform for pushing social justice values - that was really really annoying!! The fight between good and evil is already beautifully symbolic - otherwise the SJ element could at least have been done thoughtfully or cleverly like in Harry Potter & built over several movies not just shoved into one fraction of the franchise. If I had seen previous star wars movies and known they were using that approach I wouldn\'t have been in to them! Aside from other issues that other AUDIENCE reviewers cover (note I don\'t mind about the Rey/Snoke thing - I thought that was really cool), the MAIN issue for me was the death of Luke Skywalker. Okay, I acknowledge that it would be essential to kill him off at some point in the near future. But, it was such a massive disappointment to see him die without any action on his part. For me, the whole reason that star wars is as interesting and entertaining is seeing characters such as Luke rise up and do their thing - and for Gods sake Luke is meant to be the best of the best. There is a childish appeal to seeing the power/wisdom etc of the Jedi, and in a way that\'s where so many people get hooked - and Luke was ALWAYS the hero, he ALWAYS had a solution and he was totally kickass!! That\'s what I wanted to see!! THAT\'s where, for me, this movie became not a star wars movie, but something else. It would have been SO much cooler if Luke had survived, shown off some cool skills, been the leader/Jedi Master that he always was, and then died doing something else... that is what I was looking forward to most, personally, and it was very disappointing to see the main character killed off like that - I mean, in A New Hope, Obiwan dying was fine, since he was never a main character in the same way Luke was - what got the audience so enthusiastic about these new movies was finding out what Luke had been up to and seeing his story continue a little bit - I mean you spent a whole damn movie building his entrance up - knowing that people are here for the Jedi touch/action/abilities - and then he doesn\'t do anything and just dies!!! I mean, OMG???! That is just so frustrating, and not at all in the spirit of where the movies were left off. It is literally killing off a main character!! Like, imagine if during a Marvel movie where the Hulk discovers his powers and the sequel is coming out and the movie is called "The Hulk" and they kill him off in the second scene, and are like "well that\'s just poetry isn\'t it"! Or this is also like you\'re watching Captain Planet (I know lame example) and Captain Planet gets killed but the series doesn\'t finish and they go on to have a different super hero but still call it Captain Planet - it is NOT a continuation of what we had and expected before!!Anyway, sorry for the rant, & no offence to the people that worked hard to create this, but I was very very disappointed by the way this movie went - and it really left my reasons for being a star wars fan untouched and unconsidered. There were some excellent points, but you can\'t just kill off a beloved, main character like that at the wrong wrong time and change the face of a franchise.', '15'), ("  I saw ANH 4 times as a 8 year old in the cinema.

I walked out of the cinema liking it, but on thinking it through, I realised how deliberate this was as a break away movie even though wrapping itself up in the clothing of a Star Wars Series movie. Unfortunately, you cant be both.If they made this movie as an Anthology trilogy, then all good. The writers and directors can go different directions. But by virtue of the basis of this trilogy fitting into the Skywalker arc, it needed to key into the lore of the series. Constraints are not bad things guys...they can actually make things more challenging and enriching. The fact those constraints were ignored certainly opens the move up to deserving the backlash it is creating.I like others have seen the claims of BOT reviews not representing the true state of the fanbase and am posting this to show we arent all bots..As an illustration of the many issues with the movie and NOT utilising the Rich lore that could have been incorporated and actually ENHANCED the story, even my 12 year old son was able to point out that a very simple plot device to stop the Raddus Hyperspacing away could have been the Introduction of Interdictor Star Destroyers. These are lore starships from the Xwing and Tie fighter games that have gravity well generators that prevent star ships from going to hyperspace. Just this simple addition and a lot of angst could have been avoided.This is one of many examples of where the writers were just plain lazy and made up shit to suit the plot instead of integrating canon (we all know now why Disney wiped Canon).Ultimately, Disney have torn down the importance of having something to look up to or aspire to because you all have that power to what you want to be.

If you are going to get mad that they new things with the force, despite almost every Star Wars doing new things with the force (Empire expanded the Jedi abilities significantly, Jedi expanded the Sith abilities, the prequels ruined the force altogether). If you\'re going to get upset with anything, be mad at Rebels, which introduced the Force feature most are complaining about. If you\'re going to get upset with bombs "falling" in space, then you might as well get upset with the gravity on ships (if they fall in the ship, out into zero gravity, guess what they keep doing). I mean, if you get upset with the Star Wars universe not working with how you want it to work, then you probably won\'t enjoy this movie that much.If you want the Empire version of the Force Awakens, then you\'ll be really disappointed.After the Force Awakens I had a good idea of what to expect from the rest of the trilogy. I imagine most did. People weren\'t coming up with theories on how the overall play of the trilogy might differ from the other trilogies. They were coming up with theories on who was this person or that person or who might change sides, etc. The same stuff we\'ve been speculating about since Empire (which just adds to its credit). Coming out of the Last Jedi I can honestly say I have no idea what the heck is going to happen in Episode 9! And that\'s a good thing!The Last Jedi essentially picks up where The Force Awakens left off, and ends about 24 hours later. Its an examination of one of the most critical moments in a war. Where one side can finish it once and for all. Obviously, the First Order doesn\'t wipe everyone out in the end, and despite a huge setback, there\'s hope on the horizon. So, in the big picture, the film doesn\'t "move" the plot along, as some love to complain. That doesn\'t mean there isn\'t a point. That\'s like saying there was no point to Dunkirk because at the end the war hadn\'t moved along.So really, it just depends on the kind of person you are. That\'s why its such a great film. If you\'re racist or sexist and only enjoy films where white men are the heroes, you\'ll be disappointed to know that there\'s only 2 or 3 white men main characters who are epic. Yea, you\'ll hate this film. Yea, there\'s a few weird things we can universally agree upon are kind of odd, or they don\'t make sense. I dare you to point me to a Star Wars (or any film really) that doesn\'t have things that don\'t make sense (so you\'re leaving Hoth and there\'s literally an entire planet you can fly out of, why the heck would you fly right next to the ships that shoot at you? How long can a tan-tan\'s guts stay warm? So, if Boba Fett follows Han to cloud city, and he reports to the empire where the Falcon is going, how did they arrive before our heroes, as Lando explains later? Why is there gravity like, literally everywhere, even inside the asteroid monster? Why doesn\'t all the contents of the Falcon get sucked out when they leave the door open? Etc, etc) I mean, if you can\'t suspend your disbelief for this film, despite having to do it for all other Star Wars films, then you\'ll hate what they do here.Where was I? Oh yea, we all agree there\'s some stuff that falls flat, like the casino, or the milk scene for some (some thought it was the best scene in the film). Yes, a lot of it can be considered a big F.U. to the earlier films. Or it can be considered taking us step by step through the process of letting go of the earlier conventions so that we can move on to a new story, with new ideas, and a new overall plot. Just depends on how you look at it, or you can say, from a certain point of view.Personally, I loved it. There\'s definitely some valid arguments for why things don\'t make sense, and if you want to let that ruin the Star Wars universe for you, that\'s on you. I am going to watch it many times over, put up 5 stars, and debate its quality with friends, like I did with the prequels, but on the other side of the fight this time. I thinks its worth it.

Remember what anger leads to. Remember that these films honor the light side of the force. Take a moment, take a breath, and let the force be with you. If that doesn\'t help, then maybe Star Wars was lost upon you long before The Last Jedi.(speaking of, why don\'t the Sith say "May be the Force be with you" as well?

Then there were the non stop running jokes and gags that were totally out of place in a Star Wars movie (come on what works for GOTG and Thor Ragnarok does not necessarily work anywhere). And we totally did NOT need the middle bits with Canto Bight or the god awful irritating DJ and his speech ticks. The only reason I did not give this movie a 1 star was because there was some genuinely great storytelling,like the force banter between Ren and Rey (Adam Driver easily the MVP of this movie for his tortured portrayal of Ben Solo), the superbly done opening sequence which rivaled ROTS's opening with Poe taking on a Dreadnought, as well as Luke's amazing force projection sequence.

It wasn\'t a perfect movie by any means. Poe is my least favorite character he could be removed and i don\'t think he would be missed to much.

People are disappointed but after 50 years of fighting watching friends and loved ones die learning your father was Vader would have that effect on you. One of the greatest parts was watching Luke not only pull off the most powerful force display we have ever seen but in watching Luke except his failures and peacefully become one with the force thus ending his "physical existence" . Just quickly let me touch on the internet bashing brigade. You can certainly have your own opinions but, a large majority of the hate for this movie is from the internet "detectives" who spent two years trying to figure out who Ray\'s parents where and who Snoke was just to have it shown that it doesn\'t matter!

This movie is forces us to "move on" from the original trilogy, but doesn\'t give us any reason why we should do that.Full review *SPOILERS*:There are so many bad aspects on this movie I need to write them down one by one.1. CharactersRian Johnson completely butchered all of the characterization of the main characters from the original trilogy. It\'s as if these characters are completely different people. Han Solo, who used to be a badass smuggler, became a meh character on the last movie. And they even killed him disgracefully. Remember that Han always shoot first? If that\'s bad this is even worse. They make Luke as someone who is willing to murder someone else in cold blood because he "senses" that said person has great darkness within. What happened to the whole thing about Luke not willing to give up on his father? Not to mention that LUKE IS AFRAID OF REY\'S POWERS. THE FRIGGIN JEDI MASTER, SON OF ANAKIN HIMSELF! And oh, he died at the end just because he has to. Seriously. There\'s no logical reason as to why he died. He just sits there, and then he died. C\'mon, he\'s not even that old. And if you guys don\'t buy what I just said, ask Mark Hamill himself. Or rather, read his interview, and his reaction about the characterization of Luke in this movie. Also, Leia is completely undignified in this movie. Like, Poe was able to disregard all of her orders, without any consequences whatsoever. Lastly, Yoda seems to lose all his wisdom, because the actions he did as a ghost is completely nonsensical whatsoever.Now to the new characters. Rey\'s backstory is thrown out of a window, because it turns out her parents were junk dealers in Jakku. This just shows out how incompetent the writing team is. Not only that, she seems to know every single thing about everything. She learns how to wield a lightsaber by herself. She can lift rocks without any difficulties (contrary to what happened with Luke when he tried to lift an X-Wing). She even lectures Luke at one point in the movie. Then there\'s Kylo Ren. Who\'s still an emo, cheap and spoiled version of Darth Vader. Ridiculous. Also there\'s Poe, whose character is the total opposite of what he was portrayed with in The Force Awakens. Now it seems like he\'s some spoiled brat who thinks using his fist. Finn (and his new partner, forgot her name though) was quite interesting, and I\'d say Finn\'s characterization here is better than on the last movie. Other than that, the side characters aren\'t worth mentioning (including Snoke) because they didn\'t leave a lasting impact.2. StoryHere\'s where it gets really bad. The whole theme of the story was to make us "let go" of the past. In this case, Rian Johnson was trying to say that us (audience) need to let go of the original trilogy and accept the new one. But how they do it is disgusting. They killed off the characters from the original trilogy to make way for the new ones. That\'s just bad storytelling. It proves that THE CHARACTERS THEY CREATED FOR THE NEW TRILOGY WILL FOREVER BE OVERSHADOWED BY THOSE FROM THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY. They themselves admitted that, and yet, they want us to move on from the original trilogy. Their selfishness and hypocrisy knows no bounds it would seem.Not only that, there were so many plot holes in this movie. One of the most noticeable is the whole "hostage situation" going on between the First Order and the Resistance armada. The First Order could just lightspeed one of their cruisers to be in front of the Resistance armada. Then the Resistance are trapped from both sides. Another possible solution is that if any ship in lightspeed can destroy other ships, then why don\'t the Resistance just use one of their support frigates to do that from the start? Other holes were the misinterpretation of the force and it\'s powers, the definition of a "force ghost", etc etc.Another thing about this movie is how full this is of SJW bullshit. All the male characters in this movie are shown as impulsive, unwise, rebellious, etc. Want to disagree? Just look at said Luke\'s characterization. He tries to kill Kylo Ren "in a moment of pure instinct" which is bullshit, since Luke would never do something like that no matter what happens. Need another example? Poe\'s characterization as a cocky, trigger-happy, rebellious pilot. And also because of the SJW theme, all the female characters are wiser and better in every way. For example, all of the Resistance commanders are female, even all the bridge officers on-board the capital ship. Also, Rey who lectures Luke that he didn\'t fail Kylo Ren, but rather, Kylo Ren failed him (which is bullshit to begin with). There\'s also Rose who ended up sacrificing herself for Finn. Also, none of the female characters were "killed". All of them "died" (Phasma fell, not because Finn struck her. The purple-haired admiral rams her ship to Snoke\'s, Rose by sacrificing herself to save Finn), while the male characters got killed (Snoke by Kylo Ren, Admiral Ackbar when the bridge blew off, etc). Also the whole scene on the gambling planet was just trying to promote that animals are more valuable than human lives and that capitalism is bad.Finally, everything about Star Wars is gone in this film. The adventure, the whole thing about Light vs. Dark, the beautifulness of the universe, the diversity and uniqueness of each species in the movie, all gone. Also, there\'s no lightsaber duel in this movie. Which is a new low for Star Wars movies.3. CinematographyThe cinematography on this movie is just like any typical blockbuster on the recent years, Rogue One did better on this one.Conclusion:I watched this movie, and got my heart shattered because of it. It completely threw the Original Trilogy into the garbage bin, while also disregarding everything that made Star Wars feel "Star Wars". It turned Star Wars into a politically correct franchise with generic sci-fi story and generic sci-fi characters and also a generic sci-fi universe. It was bad, and Disney should retcon this and Episode VII just like what they did with the Extended Universe.Disclaimer:This is not a bot. This is from a real person and Star Wars fan, from someone who grew up with the Original Trilogy, along with many other negative reviews. The mainstream media lied once again, and their focus should be on the good reviews, because those are most likely people paid by Disney.', '05'), ('  A supreme disappointment!', '15'), ('  Great action and story, suffered from a couple of cringe worthy moments', '45'), ('  There was know character development. many original characters die. still dont know who Snoke is. Its almost as bad as the 1rst and second star wars movies.', '15'), ('  Warning - Contains Spoilers!!Before I watched this film I was aware of a disturbance in the force. Critics loved the film, but some fans were showing their displeasure. I had no idea why, so I went in feeling a bit nervous, wondering what I was about to experience.The last thing I expected to happen in the opening scene was that I\'d laugh. But when Poe stalled for time and made General Hux look like the incompetent fool he is; I was taken nicely by surprise. The opening battle was intense, loved it, what a ride!I did wonder how the First Order had managed to recover from the loss of their Starkiller base so quickly but then I realised they did the same in Empire after the Death Star was destroyed. I also realised that the First Order had wiped out the entire Republic before their base was destroyed and was now throwing everything they had to finish off the resistance. It could be what we are witnessing is the last of the First Order\'s resources, they just have substantially more than the resistance at this point. If they wipe the resistance out, there literally is no-one left in the galaxy to stand in their way. This gives the whole move a dark, desperate edge.We then switched to \'Jedi Island\'. I\'d been dreading this part. I expected Luke had turned into an Obi-Wan-Kanobi role and we\'d be in for quite a dreary series of training scenes. When he tossed aside the light sabre, I laughed unexpectedly again.At this point, I think I decided I loved what was going on, sat back and enjoyed the ride. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was being so unpredictable. I think that mental acceptance helped all the pieces of the movie fall into place. From the reviews and comments I\'ve read, if you don\'t buy into it, the opposite seems to happen. This was quite a risky approach from Johnson and I do applaud such a bold decision.We soon learn that Luke has turned into a bitter old man, full of anger and resentment at his perceived failures. His believes his moment of weakness created Kylo Ren, but Ben was already lost. Luke can\'t see this. He\'s not only isolated himself from the rest of the galaxy, but from the force itself. His concept of the Jedi is that they were a flawed concept. After watching the prequels, this was a conclusion I came to a long time ago, it was nice to hear this echoed. There should not be an elite select few chosen as guardians of the galaxy, there\'s no balance in such a concept. The fact that one Sith took down the entire Jedi proves this. The force should be there for everyone. That\'s the balance. The Last Jedi rips up this overworked Chosen One narrative and the notion that the Force should belong to only a certain elite sect.Mark Hamill was initially dead set against the script. I follow him on twitter and he even said he disagreed with every single aspect of Luke but did the job anyway. However since then he\'s said, "It took me a while to get around to his way of thinking. But once I was there, it was a thrilling experience." I think some fans will eventually get to that point as well once the shock wears off.And the dark side. I loved how the dark side tempted Rey, promising her answers to her parent\'s identity. But in the end, it simply showed her reflection. The dark side promises answers but it\'s all a lie. The dark sides isolates you until all you have left is yourself; which it then consumes.Back with the resistance, we basically have one long desperate race followed by one desperate last stand. Every small victory comes with a bitter price and not every daring plan works. This really raised the stakes.What heightened the tension here for me was the desperate plans kept on failing. Finn\'s unauthorised mission to retrieve the codebreaker, while noble and courageous, failed spectacularly. The Vice-Admiral\'s plan to sneak the transports to the base failed. The attempt to take out the Death Star cannon failed. Each failure cost lives. Each loss reduced the dwindling hope that the resistance would survive at all. We started off with hundreds of resistance personal, by the end there was about twenty.And then Luke performed that amazing Force Projection bluff. That totally fooled me, even though I should have guessed it from his new appearance. In Luke\'s final act, not only did he save the last remanence of the resistance, but in single-handily standing up to the armed might of the New Order and making Kylo Ren look like a fool, he reignited the Skywalker legend to a whole new generation of people throughout the galaxy. He\'s inspired those gifted with force powers and no doubt his sacrifice will result in many more recruits for the resistance. The showdown between Ben, Rey and Snoke also was unexpected. If Snoke had turned out to be the Emperor\'s clone, or Luke\'s Dark side, or any other predictable fan theories that\'s been banded around for the past year, it would have been disappointing. Similarly, if Rey was Ben\'s sister then we\'d now be discussing how much of an Empire clone we just watched.Sure, these types of reveals are classic Star Wars, but yet again we would have found that important characters are all conveniently connected yet are totally unaware of it. Instead, Snoke is just another Sith vying for power. I love how we\'ve gone from the Empire with powerful figures like Palpatine, Vader and Tarkin, to less competent people who\'ve taken advantage of a legacy and are desperately scrambling to maintain their position. Snoke is no Emperor and Kylo Ren really is a poor man\'s Vader; Snoke even admitted as such. He\'s been using him. Ben is trying so desperately to be Vader but he\'s a terrified little boy and yet he is growing and learning. He fooled Snoke. He thinks if he can kill the past he can define his own future. He\'s not redeemable, as Rey discovered. If this had been just a re-hash of the Luke/Vader confrontation in ROTJ I would have been disappointed. Ben now has the potential to grow into something far more dangerous than Vader ever was.And Rey is a nobody, her parents just junkers who sold her for a quick fix! I really like that. It feels far more natural than her being the long lost granddaughter of Obi-Wan or something.Johnson wasn\'t following a trilogy arc or a story arc at all, he had free reign. Yes, what he\'s done is kill the past in effect and severed ties with the classic star wars. In doing so he\'s left it wide open for a new one. I for one applaud that plus the way he did it. I think The Force Awakens didn\'t really do anyone any favours. We all complained about it being a New Hope Reboot but middle-aged fans loved the nostalgia of being an 8 year old all over again. Everyone was expecting a similar Empire reboot. While it did tread some similar ground of Empire and RoTJ, it flipped all expectations and did something new. I think it is remarkable. It was such a swan song for Carrie Fisher, all her scenes were so powerful. I went cold all over when she used the force, the first time we\'ve ever seen her do so on-screen.I have no idea what will happen next, no-one does. Rather than us all expecting a RoTJ remake next, the Star Wars universe is open for new stories, new adventure and new characters.BTW - I don\'t think the movie was perfect by far. It felt too long, I think they could cut 20 mins easy. I was disappointed that Ackbar was killed off-screen. I felt he should have been the one to do the light speed manoeuvre. I think too much effort and focus was made on Rose. She seemed likable enough but didn\'t quite work for me. For so much effort, I didn\'t feel anything at all when she sacrificed herself or that her love for Finn was real. Del Torro\'s character was also way off. He was underused and just weird. I really did like the fact that he raised the aspect of the blur between good and evil. Some folks are not evil, they are just doing business, or they switch allegiances simply to survive. I did like that point he made but it felt forced, as was his character.However, overall I thought it was awesome.', '50'), ('  I dont care about Lucas´s Canon, so i am able to see the movie as what it really is .... an AWESOME movie that i deeply enjoyed.

Snoke is? Well who cares, and let's kill him in a stupid way, that goes against how the character was built up.2. Princess Lia flying in space? We never really seen her use the force that much and now she can do all of this?3. Rey's parents. While I wanted her to be a Skywaker, the choice of her parents being just nobody's wouldn't have been as bad, if: 1. she didn't have a special bond with Luke's saber's. 2. She would have trained much more in the ways of the Jedi to develop the gifts that she has. 4. Progs: what was their role again? Yes, selling staff.5. Luke. Why was he projecting himself and not down fighting (and then dying as result) that would have been more in character with this franchise.6. The poetical messages in the movie about greed of powerful organizations, would have been much more profound and much less superficial if it didn't come from a company that boycotts journalist that give it bad reviews or forces distribution agreements on theaters.7. This is less about the movie but about the reactions from some to fans who didn't like the movie: conspiracy theories about right wing people posting negative comments (seriously that is one of the claims to explain the negative reviews), or people who liked the Justice League movie exacting their revenge on the critics who loved the last Jedi (again, seriously that is one of the claims to explain the negative reviews), or if you didn't like the movie it means that you are against minorities (as mentioned, I loved the Force Awakens introduction of a strong female character and the other nontraditional star wars characters). I don't believe in those kind of conspires but some of those issues make me think that perhaps there is some sort of projection here by the side that did say the movie was good. There is also the issue of people saying that it's our problem if we don't like this movie, and we should like it, why? They have the right to like the movie and express their views, and we have the right not to like it, and express our views.8.

In the original movies the Empire was extremely strong after having used politics to legitimately take over the Republic which was made up of thousands of worlds and species. In this new trilogy the First Order destroyed a handful of planets with the starkiller base and now in this film the First Order has suddenly taken over everything with no explanation of how their tiny military managed to take on a republic of thousands of worlds. I have no problem with them somehow getting the upper hand on the good guys but at least explain it. Apart from that the new writers have zero understanding of what it means to be a jedi or how the force works, or they just conveniently forgot in order to make Luke look like a depressed hermit. Even after Yoda and Obi Wan were at the helm of a jedi order that let down the entire galaxy and created darth vader they didnt get depressed and just focused on how they could make things better by helping Luke. Not here, now Jedi make one little mistake and are responsible for perhaps the least threatening sith lord ever and suddenly get super depressed and abandon all of their friends and family to die. Sci fi movies like this are dependent on creating a cohesive world with logical back stories and rules that help give the story a feeling of reality which helps with immersion. The writers of this film just blindly wander from one scene to another without ever taking the time to use the real world of the star wars universe to their advantage. Also on top of all that the space chase which lasts almost the entire movie is really poorly done. For one thing they create this new idea that the huge capital ships of the star wars universe rely on fuel. Not even the aircraft carriers and submarines of our modern navy do this since they have nuclear reactors that can let them stay at sea for decades if necessary. I'm sure star wars technology would be on at least the same level as our modern navy. And then on top of that the First Order ships laughingly cant catch up to the Resistance ships because they are bigger. In space the bigger ships would have bigger engines and therefore be faster since it is a vacuum and there is no resistance to slow the bigger ship down. This idiotic premise goes on for nearly 3 quarters of the movie. Rey and Finn were not as annoying as they were in the Force Awakens which I appreciated but Finn's subplot doesnt really matter in the story. They make you think it does but in the end pretty much everything he and Poe does is irrelevant.Also thought we were gonna get some interesting backstory on Snoke but that story is randomly cut short. Unlike when Vader takes out Palpatine which is a gradual process that builds up over the course of three films and is hugely satisfying here its kind of tacked on.And finally, Luke's death. I honestly think I would have liked the movie alot more if Luke hadnt died. A) Its depressing and B) It makes no sense. After getting into a rather interesting fight with Kylo Ren we find out he had just used a force projection, okay clever Luke we thought. Then it cuts back to his hermitage where he's looking at the suns in a homage to his Tattooine days and we think, cool he's gotten back to his roots now he's gonna kick ass like in the old days, but then he just dies.

Here are some of the things I liked and disliked about the movie.Likes:- The opening sequence with Rose's sister opening the bomber hatch was awesome. It was directed in a way that creates a lot of real world tension and suspense that isn't very common in the more 'fantasy' world of Star Wars.- Kylo Ren and Rey's light saber battle versus Snoke's red guards was pretty bad-ass. Also liked that Kylo killed Snoke; helping to set up Kylo as the true antagonist of this new trilogy of Star Wars films.- Finn vs Captain Phasma was pretty cool and helps to kind of set up Finn as a capable warrior; as opposed to the bumbling buffoon that he appears to be in the majority of both films.- The reveal that Rey's parents were nobodies was a pretty cool revelation about the Force. I like that anybody can use the Force powers; and not just the Skywalker 'related' bloodline.- Laura Dern's character sending the Rebel ship into light speed directly into the First Order command ship was awesome; probably the best part of the whole movie.Dislikes:- Leia floating back to the ship after being blown into space was pretty dumb. It was just a convenient way to undo a very risky decision regarding her character. I just don't buy it.- The whole Finn and Rose trip to Canto Bight was a waste of time. Totally unnecessary since the 'code breaker' they were seeking did not factor into the rest of the movie one bit. It was just a dumb narrative decision.- Poe's mutiny against Laura Dern's character Holdo was so stupid and just a complete waste of time, since she had a secret plan that made his whole mutiny moot. What's the point of Holdo withholding this information in the first place?- Rey's entire time on the Jedi temple island was a complete waste of time. She didn't gain anything from being there. The only real revelation she got the whole movie was regarding her parentage, and that was given to her by Kylo Ren. More fluff that bloated the movies runtime.- The whole entire movie the First Order's ship is chasing down the Rebel ship, really? Could they both fly any slower?- Rose 'romantic' relationship and love towards Finn was stupid and unnecessary; totally forced.- Luke Skywalker senses darkness in Kylo Ren, and his first inclination is to try to kill him as he sleeps? That's so sneaky and weasily if you ask me. Not the Luke Skywalker I know (who risked everything to try and save Darth Vader from the dark side).- The Rebels get cornered by the First Order into a cave and have no way out.... only, there is a way out. They just needed to look a little harder. It made all the tension of them actually being trapped into a corner seem stupid and wasted.Maybe I'm being a bit harsh with my nitpicking, but this is Star Wars; we expect better. Overall, I enjoyed the move. I'll give it a 6.5/10.", '30'), ('  My bottom line up front on this is that it ranks somewhere around the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. It\'s not a good movie...period. Not just "Star Wars", but "movie"...bad. It barely advances the story-line we\'ve been following, has too many different plot-lines, and gives you very little to emotionally invest in any one character, save for maybe Luke at very end...but only then and really only for nostalgic reasons. It\'s not that I can\'t deal with them changing the direction of the saga. The fact is it\'s a poorly written movie that is far too long and rather boring. The various plot lines going on leave you with many head scratchers that simply don\'t make sense or don\'t advance the plot. Way too many stupid, campy, slapstick jokes. It\'s just bad. Here\'s a few questions about all this: Why is the Resistance using carpet-bomb techniques from WWII? Why do Finn and Rose have this completely useless side-story? So we can get Rose talking about freeing-horses and how rich people are bad? If that\'s a major theme you want to bring out in a movie, it would seriously help if you made the audience believe that. As it is, it\'s choppy at best. Why in the world do we have to sit through the SLOWEST. CHASE. EVER? I\'m really supposed to believe that the First Order doesn\'t have any ships that can speed up there, wipe out the Resistance, and move on with their day? Really? Why didn\'t Holdo share her plan about the escape pods? What would\'ve been the harm in that? Absolutely nothing. There was no operational secrecy that needed to be maintained on that ship. It was a dumb, plot device to make Poe look more like a hothead and attempt to strengthen Holdo\'s character.Speaking of Holdo, why does she have to go on a suicide mission? You mean to tell me that they don\'t have programmable computers on that ship? I can program my damn coffee maker to turn on at 6am and you can\'t program a damn ship to go to hyperspace in say, 15 minutes? SMH....Let\'s move on to Luke\'s character. Ok, so he has some PTSD problems from his encounter with Kylo back in the day. Rrrrriiiiggghhttt...because the guy who redeemed his father from the dark side just felt that the right thing to do was to eliminate Kylo when he was being pulled to the dark side. Yeah. That makes sense. Who thinks up this crap? Moving on, he\'s a hermit, possibly suicidal, and wants to be left alone. But then out of nowhere, he decides to "teach" Rey...of which we see basically nothing. If you\'re going to write that the character is a teacher it might help to actually show some of that. As it is, we\'re left to believe that Rey is some kind of completely exceptional character in all the history of Force users. She doesn\'t need any training, she comes fully programmed.Then we have Yoda\'s cameo where he seems to be more a Muppet from Fraggle Rock than the wizened, old Master Jedi who instructed Luke on Dagobah.Finally, Kylo and Snoke. Snoke is shown to us as being this effortlessly powerful master of the Dark Side of the Force, capable of reading minds, bridging Rey and Kylo\'s minds (in a weird sort of \'texting\' way...whatever), etc. But then he\'s easily bisected by Kylo who just sorted sneaks in a little Force use on the lightsaber next to Snoke.All of this results in one big discombobulated movie that you struggle to sit through for 2.5 hours, hoping to God it\'s going to get better but are ultimately disappointed because it just gets worse.', '10'), ("  First Star Wars movie in a long time which really dares to renew the franchise.

A bizarre timeline, I presume this film takes place with two separate timelines, one much shorter than the other, but even then it makes relatively little sense and is poorly directed so that it is never made clear.2.

Kylo-Ren being in no way a major threat as the main big-bad and a no-surprise character. Can he be defeated? Well yes actually because we've already seen him be defeated by Rey. Is he conflicted and could he turn to the light? Well yes because the whole movie repeatedly hits us over the head with the fact that he is conflicted.5.

Vice-Admiral 'Dame Edna Everage Plot Hole Creator' Haldo (I think that was her name, I couldn't care to spend much time learning it). Not only does Oscar-nominated actress Laura Dern truly 'phone it in' with a performance that was practically chewing the scenery, but the character is so obvious in the whole 'you think I'm going to be a bad girl but actually I'm a goody' arc that it was hardly a surprise when she decided to go kamikaze (20 minutes late) at the end and her character should simply have been Ackbar, in order to give that iconic character the swansong he deserved.9. That leads nicely into the gripe about plot-holes in general. Not only the obvious fact that I thought the moment Leia left her ship heading for Crate that if I was Vice-Admiral Purple Wig I would turn the ship around and crash it into the enemy, but that it then took her character twenty minutes to decide that and only after watching pretty much the entire rebellion being blown to pieces. She also creates another plot-hole early on by being unnecessarily cagey about her plans seemingly in order to create a pointless sub-plot.10. Said pointless subplot of the space-casino, just awful and made some really blunt ham-fisted points about complex political issues like capitalism, slavery and animal welfare.11. Rose, great actress, had the potential to be a great character, completely misused and pushed into a pretty unbelievable romance.12. Finn not sacrificing himself.13. Phasma, you wait decades for a decent (in fact any) female Star Wars villain and along comes one who looks amazing, is played by a superb and physically intimidating actress, who is then completely wasted by being nothing but a sack of potatoes clad in chrome, who goes down twice in two movies to her former employee, a former star-destroyer janitor.14. Well if Phasma is bad then Hux is still there to intimidate right? Nope... Hux has made the most severe about turn ever in the space of just a few days and has gone from Hitler-in-space to being just a punchline and a punchbag who leaves you wondering if the First Order is this inept how the hell did they ever get so big and so grand in the first place?15. A lot of the rest of the humour, as detailed above, was terrible and misplaced.16. Rey's parental reveal was two fingers up to audience.17. Maz Kanata was poorly used (again another great actress, Lupita Nyongo, wasted) and unnecessary to the plot, she should have just been on Leia's ship, it would have made sense, her home was destroyed in TFA. Felt as though Nyongo was just contractually obliged to appear somewhere.18. No explanation as to how Maz came across the lightsabre and no mention of the Knights of Ren either.19. Every scene that contained Benicio Del Toro trying to be Lando and in the process giving us the most embarrassing attempt at a speech-impediment in acting history.20. Finally and worse of all, you can walk away from this movie questioning everything you have seen and heard and pondering on it for ages. But you do not walk away from this movie in anyway questioning what might be to come or feeling excited to see what might happen, I have none of the feeling that I had after TFA (or for that fact even the prequels) upon leaving the cinema, that feeling of 'I wish the next film was out now so I could get some answers and some more excitement'.

As a Star Wars film - it is fresh and not a re-tread (to say this 8 films into a series is quite an achievement).I don\'t understand the backlash against it - people who say they went in expecting answers about who Snoke was, and who Rey\'s parents are, as a result of the film that came before The Last Jedi (The Force Awakens).The Force Awakens did not "introduce" Snoke so much as have him simply "there" (clearly as someone who was Kylo/Ben\'s master). Clearly, he knew (or knew of) Darth Vader, and rose up after the Emperor - but I did not leave The Force Awakens thinking - Gee, this movie set up a mystery of where did Snoke come from and how exactly did he end up in such a position of power. Why do we have the need to be told everything about a character and not have some things unanswered. He was powerful and in control of The First Order and Kylo/Ben - but the movie was not about Snoke, it was about Kylo/Ben.I can\'t recall The Force Awakens anywhere teasing us about a revelation regarding Snoke, and as for Rey - yes, in that film she is "searching" for where she came from - but the emphasis was on the search being her inner journey not a mystery set up in the film where we as viewers are putting pieces together about her parents.Again, some fans after The Force Awakens (so used to the way past films played out) expected a reveal that had her related to someone - but that is not what The Force Awakens was about. The emphasis was on Rey\'s character and what it meant for her to not know who she was or where she came from. So when The Last Jedi came out - the reveal about Rey and the death of Snoke furthered the character development of both Rey and Kylo/Ben. They didn\'t undermine the plot of The Force Awakens, nor did they throw out any mystery "set up" by that film. Fans assumed (wrongly) that there was a mystery. The fact that Rey was told by Maz that the lightsaber calls to her and that she had visions when holding it at first does not mean she was connected by bloodline to Luke/Ben (Kenobi) etc. She was clearly Force-strong. That was the extent of her connection. And it made her afraid.Luke was reckless (in ANH and ESB) - called out by Yoda always looking to the future and never on where he was and what he was doing. Training for him was needed - but some people are naturally gifted and Rey clearly has the gift (while also having the gutso to take on Luke and Kylo/Ben).The Last Jedi is a film that has many layers - and has emotional depth. The first death of Paige, and the death of Holdo, are both of characters we (at least on film) had never met before - but they were affecting and sent chills down my spine.I have seen the film 3 times - the first time, I was a little unsure of how I felt as the film did not go where I thought it would. But the second and third viewings have cemented the film as the best of all SW movies - even the casino scene was a diversion that did not go on for long, and had purpose to the theme of the film and also showed not all infiltrations will succeed.This movie has a depth and rawness that has not been captured in a SW film before.Luke was not "ruined" as some claim - this is not the Luke we last saw in Return of the Jedi, but at the same time, this is 30 years later, with so much that has happened to him since. It is one thing to redeem your fallen father, but to take on the responsibility to train your nephew, trusted by your sister and friend, and then to think about killing him after seeing the dark side in him - which is understandable given all that Luke had seen the dark side do over since ANH - that would lead any person to feel shame and guilt and to question everything.Complaints have also centred around Phasma - she was not set up to be anything more than a foil for Finn. She added texture to the plot. Some fans seem upset that she died and did not have a greater role to play. She was by no means set up as a main character and anything more than a character to lend colour to a film and round it out. Not every side-character no matter how cool needs to live on and be involved in the main plot.I saw this the first time with my 12yo son and 10yo daughter (all of us have seen all SW films). We all enjoyed it. I reserved judgment until my 2nd viewing - and on my second viewing (with my 12yo son and his 13yo friend and another adult SW fan/friend) we all thoroughly enjoyed it and I found it very enriching now that I could watch it knowing it was not going to pander to my expectations (regarding plot, not regarding how characters should or shouldn\'t behave). My third viewing (with my wife who loves a good film but is not a SW fan (though she has casually seen them all thanks to me!) - and I absolutely was enthralled and moved by the film again, and my wife (who\'d not seen The Force Awakens since 2015) was also glued to her seat and thoroughly enjoyed the film - as a great film (irrespective of it being a Star Wars film).No "I am your father" revelation - but it\'s a film that as a result will stand up to multiple viewings and dissection of meaning.

The story is just great, a fresh take on the SW universe. And yet everything that makes SW is there: politics, space battles, the Force, lightsabers... I'll keep spoilers to a minimum, the best scene in my opinion is when Ben and Rey battle the praetorian guards together. Clearly, until the conclusion of that battle the lines are blurred. Light side/dark side are the Force and nothing is certain until the charachters consciously choose which path they will follow. SW VIII is truly epic and fittingly it gives us HOPE that the conclusion to the current trilogy will surpass this one.", '45'), ("  I really loved it, had a great moment watching it, just can't wait to see the last one !", '50'), ('  Absolutely the worst Star Wars movie to date. Disney chose to hijack the Star Wars saga into a two hour political documentary. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. This movie is AWFUL! And just for reference, I am a HUGE Star Wars fan. ZERO STARS', '05'), ("  Short non-spoiler review - Ok film, but a big disappointment. Save your money to the DVD or Blu-Ray release. SPOILER REVIEWThe reason why I am so disappointed is just how many plot holes and half-thought through ideas there are. I can look beyond them if the film is really good or fun (e.g. Star Trek and the whole red matter nonsense) but when the film is sub-par any mistakes/issue just become massive beacons, especially when they dont make any sense compared to previous films.WHAT WAS THE PLOT? - So since Ep7 we are told that the First Order (FO) have taken over the galaxy, despite Starkiller base being destroyed, and they are hunting the last Resistance fighters. And at the end of the film the bad guys are still chasing the good guys. Wow, that was interesting.WORLD LONGEST CHASE - This part of the movie takes up almost two thirds of the film and is dull. Plus as ships can come and go as they please any tension is lost by the chase. Also why not just send one FO Star Destroyer slightly ahead at hyperspace and then catch up with Leia's ship? No, lets just chase them until their fuel runs out. STAR WARS MEETS PIRATES OF THE CAIBBEAN - Why do lasers in Ep8 dip and arc like 17th century cannon fire in this film (when they never did before)? Why also do disabled or destroyed ships sink like they are in the sea? Also why do bombers 'drop' bombs in space?SNOKES SCARY BIG SHIP - They introduce Snoke's big ship, the Supremacy, but apart from size what is so scary or threatening about it? The Death Star was a fearsome planet killer, StarKiller base also was a clear threat to the galaxy, even the Dreadnought at the star of this film seemed quite dangerous, but all Snoke's ship can do is chase Leias ship at the same speed, fire lasers that are more like cannons in the 17th century, and gets cut in two by a far smaller ship at the end. Pointless.HYPERSPACE DEATH MOVE- So a Resistance ship, piloted by a purple haired admiral we just met, can wipe out a far bigger FO ship by hyper spacing into it. Why couldn't one of Snoke's spare Star Destroyers he had just hyperspace into Leia's ship rather than chase it for 1 hour?Also as this is clearly such a powerful tactic why don't other Resistance ships just constantly take out massive Star Destroyers using this tactic? After all, you only need one semi-competent person to fly a ship according to this film. Porkins in his X-Wing could have just hyperspaced into the Deathstar in Ep4, and Lando could have hyperspaced the Falcon into the Deathstar 2 in Ep6. If you are going to introduce an all powerful move at least the producers should think it through.SUPERWOMAN - Oh dear, that scene where Leia floats through space is simply cringeworthy. Also we all know Leia is force sensitive but she has basic powers. Yet she single handedly becomes the most powerful user that ever lived by coming back to life, in space, and flying herself to safety. And when they are trapped on the planet later she is unable to move some rocks until Rey shows up. YODA IS NOW A GOD - Yoda is so powerful a Jedi now that he can also cause storms and lighting bolts even from the dead. So between Ep3 and 4 why didn't he just wait for Emperor Palpatine to be walking down the road before striking him down with a storm? SNOKE WHO - we had a villain, who clearly would never match Palpatine in evilness, but he was interesting. Plus we wanted to know what his plan (if any) was. Then he is killed off with little explanation or answers on anything. Also why did Snoke's character have to be CGI or done by Andy Serkis when he doesn't actually do anything but sit in a chair? MORALS - Rose, the new character, doesn't like the planet they visit as its full of rich people getting richer through war profiteering and slavery. That is meant to have some deep and meaningful insight into her character? Surely most Resistance fighters would share her view, so why is Rose so special here?The biggest moral statement in the film, but is glossed over in 5 seconds, was DJ's point that the Resistance are hypocrites and there are truly no 'good guys' given they also use the same war merchants to get their arms. Shame that point wasn't expanded further, but then I guess the point would go over most kids heads.LUKES END - He force projects to Klyo Ren on the planet, and then dies with no explanation back on the island. He may as well have flown to the planet and done a Obi-Wan disappear force death with Kylo Ren than this really weird death scene. Also Luke's death is so 'meh', which is a shame given he is such an important part of these films.BATTERING RAM - Snoke's ship has been cut in half, but don't worry guys we managed to save the big battering ram! Also good job the FO packed one in the first place. Snoke couldn't foresee a lightsabre turning by his side but he did have the foresight to pack a battering ram to a space ship chase!REY - What was the point of her entering that dark butt hole on Luke's planet? It is clear now that Disney simply do not have the guts to make Rey turn to the dark side, given they want every hero in films to be a woman now, so her flirting with the dark side is a waste of time. I'd rather see more Kylo Ren being tormented and torn between the light and dark.", '20'), ('  Worst Star Wars movie ever. Destroys the Star Wars character and punches fans in the face.', '05'), ("  As a movie by itself, I really liked it. AS far as the controversy of Lukes death, I guess I just didn't have as much of a connection to him. I thought his death aligned perfectly with Jedi of the past. Yoda and Obi-Wan both became longtime recluses seeking solitude. His character did save the resistance and became an eternal hero. What did piss me off was that Rey came from nobodies, hopefully, thats a ruse for part 9. The space battles to me seemed really cheap, can't put my finger on why maybe its the cannon fire having arcs like they were in gravity when they were in space? Maybe that there really was no point other than to have a space battle, maybe it people walking around with gaping holes in the hulls like they could function, physics doesn't exist I guess?
