5,"To help combat the slew of stupidity from nacissitic SW ""fans"" - I must say this movie is all around brilliant. Cinematogrophy is overflowing with beauty, directed in a elegant form, edited to max cathartic pay-off, all technicalties of TLJ are perfect.

The story and plot is a great base line that allows major storylines of character development to take place. Stop complaining about the fuel logic, you shouldnt think it over that much...

Taking down the jedi and sith was perfect.

Let go of the past... kill it.

Rian Johnson a genius."
0.5,"Ruined my childhood hero, Luke Skywalker's legacy. It's no wonder Mark Hamill fundamentally disagreed with everything written for his character. Unforgivable."
5,"Loved this. Such a great addition to the traditions and fun of the series. I laughed, I cried, I wanted so many toys. I love the new characters, appreciated that it didn't take itself too seriously (except Kylo Ren, because of course he did), and the worlds they built were gorgeous. Fantastic."
1.5,Excess plot lines and no learning or growth from the characters introduced in the previous film created a convoluted mess that feels way too Disney will trying to hard to also be Star Wars and thereby being neither.
